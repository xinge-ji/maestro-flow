## Report Status (Required)

Before finishing, run exactly this command (substitute values based on what
you accomplished). This is the ONLY way the coordinator learns your result —
text output alone is not read.

```
maestro coordinate report \
  --session {{SESSION_ID}} \
  --node {{NODE_ID}} \
  --status <SUCCESS|FAILURE> \
  [--verification <passed|failed|pending>] \
  [--review <PASS|WARN|BLOCK>] \
  [--uat <passed|failed|pending>] \
  [--phase <number>] \
  [--artifact <path>] [--artifact <path>] \
  [--summary "<one-line what was accomplished>"]
```

Legacy fallback (only if the report command is unavailable): append this
block at the end of your output. The coordinator will parse it as a
last-resort contract.

```
