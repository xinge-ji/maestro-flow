# Debug Workflow

Debug issues using scientific method with subagent isolation. Supports three modes:

1. **Standalone**: User describes issue, gather symptoms via 5 questions
2. **From UAT**: --from-uat reads uat.md gaps as pre-filled symptoms (skip gathering)
3. **Parallel**: --parallel spawns one debug agent per gap cluster concurrently

Output: understanding.md + evidence.ndjson per investigation.
When root causes found, auto-updates originating uat.md with diagnosis.

### Step 1: Check Active Sessions

```bash
# Check scratch dirs (resolved via artifact registry) for debug sessions
find .workflow/scratch -path "*/.debug/*" -name "understanding.md" 2>/dev/null | head -5
find .workflow/scratch -type d -name "debug-*" 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

**If active sessions exist AND no $ARGUMENTS:**

Read each session's understanding.md header for status and current hypothesis.

Display:
```
## Active Debug Sessions

| # | Location | Status | Current Hypothesis |
|---|----------|--------|--------------------|
| 1 | scratch/plan-auth-2026-04-20/.debug/jwt-expiry/ | investigating | Token not refreshed on 401 |
| 2 | scratch/debug-nav-crash-2026-03-14/ | checkpoint | Awaiting user input |

Reply with a number to resume, or describe a new issue.
```

Wait for user response.
- Number -> resume that session (load state, go to Step 11: Spawn Continuation)
- Text -> treat as new issue (go to Step 3 or Step 2)

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Active session found, no args | Offer resume list |
| Active session found, args given | Start new investigation |
| No active sessions, no args | Error E001 |
| No active sessions, args given | Continue to appropriate mode |

If resuming: load understanding.md + evidence.ndjson, spawn continuation agent.

---

### Step 1.5: Load Project Specs

```
specs_content = maestro spec load --category debug
```

Pass to debug agents as prior knowledge (known issues, root causes, workarounds).

---

### Step 2: Load UAT Gaps (if --from-uat)

Skip if --from-uat is not set. Go to Step 3 instead.

Read `{artifact_dir}/uat.md` Gaps section (artifact_dir resolved from artifact registry). For each gap:
```yaml
- test: T-003
  truth: "User can reply to comments"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: clicking reply does nothing"
  severity: major
  requirement_ref: SC-002
```

**Cluster gaps by component/area:**
- Parse affected features from truth + reason
- Group by likely component (same module, same flow, same file area)
- Each cluster becomes one debug investigation

| Clustering | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Same component | T-003 (reply) + T-004 (edit comment) -> "comment-actions" cluster |
| Same flow | T-001 (login) + T-002 (session) -> "auth-flow" cluster |
| Unrelated | T-005 (nav color) -> standalone "nav-styling" cluster |

**Extract issue references for context enrichment:** For each gap with an `issue_id`, look up the matching issue in `.workflow/issues/issues.jsonl` and attach `issue_context` (severity, feedback, fix_direction, context) to the gap. Pass to debug agent prompts for richer diagnosis.

If --parallel is set: go to Step 5: Spawn Parallel Debuggers.
If --parallel is not set: investigate clusters sequentially (Step 6: Spawn Single Debugger per cluster).

---

### Step 3: Gather Symptoms (standalone mode only)

Skip if --from-uat is set.

Generate a slug from issue description (lowercase, hyphens, max 40 chars).

Ask 5 questions via AskUserQuestion:
1. "What should happen? (expected behavior)"
2. "What happens instead? (actual behavior)"
3. "Any error messages? Paste them or describe."
4. "When did this start? Did it ever work?"
5. "How do you trigger this? (reproduction steps)"

Also gather automated context:
```bash
git log --oneline -10 2>/dev/null
git diff --stat HEAD~3 2>/dev/null
```

Store all responses. Confirm: "Symptoms gathered. Starting investigation..."
Create debug session directory and proceed to Step 6.

---

### Step 4: Determine Output Directory

| Mode | Directory |
|------|-----------|
| Phase-scoped (from UAT) | `{ARTIFACT_DIR}/.debug/{gap-slug}/` (ARTIFACT_DIR resolved from artifact registry) |
| Standalone | `.workflow/scratch/debug-{slug}-{date}/` |

Resolve `DEBUG_DIR` from artifact registry:
- Phase-scoped: look up phase in `.workflow/state.json` artifacts (type=execute), set `DEBUG_DIR = ".workflow/{art.path}/.debug/{gap-slug}/"`. Error if not found.
- Standalone: `DEBUG_DIR = ".workflow/scratch/debug-{slug}-{date}/"`

Create the directory.

---

### Step 5: Spawn Parallel Debug Agents

For each cluster, spawn concurrently as general-purpose agent (`run_in_background: false`):

- **Input**: cluster name, phase, all gaps (test_id, truth, reason, severity). Mode: `symptoms_prefilled`.
- **Process**: read source files, form 2-3 hypotheses per gap ranked by likelihood, search code for evidence, log each as NDJSON line, confirm/refute.
- **Output per gap**: `root_cause`, `fix_direction`, `affected_files` (file:line), `confidence` (high/medium/low), `evidence` summary.
- **Files**: `{debug_dir}/evidence-{cluster_slug}.ndjson`, `{debug_dir}/understanding-{cluster_slug}.md`

All agents run concurrently. Collect all results.

---

### Step 5.5: CLI Supplementary Evidence Gathering (optional)

**Purpose:** Use external CLI tool for broad codebase evidence collection before spawning debug agents. Provides agents with richer context without consuming their token budget on exploration.

**Skip if** no enabled CLI tools or standalone mode with minimal context.

```
IF no CLI tools enabled: skip to Step 6

# Build evidence request from symptoms
symptom_summary = symptoms or gap descriptions, concatenated

Bash({
  command: 'maestro delegate "PURPOSE: Gather codebase evidence related to a bug investigation
TASK: Trace call chains for affected functions | Find recent changes to related files | Identify error handling gaps | Check for similar patterns elsewhere
MODE: analysis
CONTEXT: @${affected_files or scoped_path}/**/*
EXPECTED: JSON { call_chains: [{ entry, chain: [file:line...] }], recent_changes: [{ file, commits: [...] }], error_gaps: [{ file, line, description }], similar_patterns: [{ file, line, description }] }
CONSTRAINTS: Focus on code paths related to the symptoms | Max 20 entries per category

Symptoms: ${symptom_summary}
" --role explore --mode analysis',
  run_in_background: true
})
```

**On callback:**
```
cli_evidence = maestro delegate output <id>
Parse and append to evidence.ndjson with type: "cli-exploration"
Pass cli_evidence as supplementary_context to debug agent prompts in Step 5/6
```

---

### Step 6: Spawn Single Debug Agent (sequential mode)

Spawn general-purpose agent (`run_in_background: false`) with:

- **Input**: slug, description, symptoms (expected, actual, errors, reproduction, timeline). `symptoms_prefilled: {true if from UAT}`, goal: `find_and_fix`.
- **Process**: form hypotheses ranked by likelihood, test each (design test, execute, log NDJSON evidence, update understanding.md).
- **Return one of**: `## ROOT CAUSE FOUND` (+ cause, evidence, fix), `## CHECKPOINT REACHED` (+ what's needed from user), `## INVESTIGATION INCONCLUSIVE` (+ what was checked/eliminated).
- **Files**: `{$DEBUG_DIR}/understanding.md`, `{$DEBUG_DIR}/evidence.ndjson`

Handle result based on agent output type.

---

### Step 7: Collect and Unify Results

For each agent result, extract:
- root_cause per gap
- fix_direction per gap
- affected_files per gap
- confidence level
- evidence summary

Build unified diagnosis:
```json
{
  "session_id": "{debug session ID}",
  "completed_at": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "clusters": [
    {
      "name": "{cluster_name}",
      "gaps": [
        {
          "test_id": "T-003",
          "root_cause": "...",
          "fix_direction": "...",
          "affected_files": ["src/components/Comments.tsx:42"],
          "confidence": "high"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 7.1: Update Issues with Diagnosis

For each diagnosed gap with an `issue_id`, update the corresponding issue in `.workflow/issues/issues.jsonl`:
- Set `status: "diagnosed"`, `context.suggested_fix: fix_direction`, `context.notes: root_cause`, `updated_at: now()`
- Append to `issue_history`: `{ from: previous_status, to: "diagnosed", changed_at: now(), actor: "debug-agent" }`

Display: "Updated {count} issues with diagnosis results"

---

### Step 8: Update UAT (if --from-uat)

Skip if standalone mode.

For each diagnosed gap, update the uat.md Gaps section:
```yaml
- test: T-003
  truth: "User can reply to comments"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: clicking reply does nothing"
  severity: major
  root_cause: "Reply handler not wired to API endpoint"
  fix_direction: "Connect onReply to POST /api/comments/{id}/reply"
  affected_files: ["src/components/Comments.tsx:42", "src/api/comments.ts:78"]
```

This closes the UAT -> debug feedback loop.

---

### Step 9: Handle Root Cause Found

Display root cause, evidence, and fix recommendation.

```
------------------------------------------------------------
  ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
------------------------------------------------------------

{root cause description}

Evidence:
{key evidence points with file:line references}

Recommended fix:
{fix recommendation}

------------------------------------------------------------
Options:
1. Fix now -- Skill({ skill: "maestro-quick", args: "apply fix" })
2. Plan fix -- Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan", args: "{phase} --gaps" })
3. Manual fix -- investigate/fix yourself
------------------------------------------------------------
```

---

### Step 10: Handle Checkpoint

Parse checkpoint type and details. Present to user via AskUserQuestion.
If user provides input: spawn continuation agent with prior state + user response.
If user wants to pause: save state, exit.

---

### Step 11: Handle Inconclusive

Display what was checked and eliminated. Offer:
1. Continue investigating (fresh agent with prior state)
2. Add more context (gather additional symptoms)
3. Manual investigation (pause session)

---

### Step 12: Spawn Continuation Agent

Load prior state (understanding.md + evidence.ndjson).
Build continuation prompt with user's checkpoint response.
Handle return the same way (root cause / checkpoint / inconclusive).

---

### Step 13: Report

```
=== DEBUG SESSION ===
Mode:        {standalone | from-uat | parallel}
Target:      {issue or phase}

Clusters:    {cluster_count} investigated
Gaps:        {total_gaps} total
  Diagnosed: {diagnosed_count} root causes found
  Uncertain: {uncertain_count} need more investigation

Files:
  {debug_dir}/understanding.md (or understanding-{cluster}.md per cluster)
  {debug_dir}/evidence.ndjson (or evidence-{cluster}.ndjson per cluster)

UAT Updated: {yes/no} ({uat_path} if yes)

Next steps:
  {suggested_next_command}
```

**Next step routing:**

| Result | Suggestion |
|--------|------------|
| All root causes found | Skill({ skill: "maestro-quick", args: "apply fixes" }) or Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan", args: "--gaps" }) |
| Some inconclusive | Resume with more context or manual investigation |
| From UAT, all diagnosed | Skill({ skill: "quality-test", args: "{phase} --auto-fix" }) to trigger gap-fix loop |

---

## Evidence Format

**evidence.ndjson -- one JSON object per line:**

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-03-14T10:30:00+08:00","hypothesis":"JWT token not refreshed on 401","action":"grep for 401 handler","result":"Found handler but no refresh call","conclusion":"confirmed"}
```

Each line is a self-contained investigation step. Append-only.
