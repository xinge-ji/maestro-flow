<purpose>
Turn a user's natural-language instruction into a command overlay — a JSON patch file that augments one or more `.claude/commands/*.md` files non-invasively. Overlays live at `~/.maestro/overlays/` and are auto-applied by every `maestro install` run, so injected steps survive reinstalls. Use this skill when the user says things like "always run CLI verification after `/maestro-execute`", "require reading doc X before `/maestro-plan`", or "add a `ccw cli` quality check at the end of every quality-review".
</purpose>

<context>
**Overlay model** — an overlay is a JSON file with a `name`, one or more `targets` (command names without `.md`), and a list of `patches`. Each patch targets an XML section (`execution`, `required_reading`, `context`, `success_criteria`, etc.), a mode (`append`, `prepend`, `replace`, `new-section`), and `content`. On apply, the patcher wraps the content in hashed HTML-comment markers so re-apply is idempotent and removal is surgical.

**Where overlays live**
- User overlays: `~/.maestro/overlays/*.json` — created by this skill
- Shared docs: `~/.maestro/overlays/docs/*.md` — referenced via `@~/.maestro/overlays/docs/*.md` inside patch content
- Shipped examples: `~/.maestro/overlays/_shipped/` — read-only, do not edit

**Management** — listing and removing overlays is handled by `maestro overlay list` (ink TUI with interactive delete). This skill focuses solely on creation.

**Available sections** (for `section:` in patches): `purpose`, `required_reading`, `deferred_reading`, `context`, `execution`, `error_codes`, `success_criteria`.
</context>

<execution>
### 1. Parse user intent

Treat the argument as natural-language intent. If unclear, ask up to 2 questions with AskUserQuestion: (a) which command(s) to target, (b) where in the command flow the injection should happen.

### 2. Identify targets, injection points, and visualize

For each likely target command, read the pristine source from `$PKG_ROOT/.claude/commands/<name>.md` (preferred — untouched by overlays) or fall back to `~/.claude/commands/<name>.md`. Inspect the XML sections and pick the right one:

- **New step after execution** → `section: execution`, `mode: append`
- **Required reading** → `section: required_reading`, `mode: append`
- **Preconditions / gating** → `section: context`, `mode: append`
- **Output quality gate** → `section: success_criteria`, `mode: append`

If the user wants a whole new section, use `mode: new-section` with `afterSection: execution` (or whichever anchor makes sense).

**Injection point preview** — after selecting section + mode, render the target command's section map showing existing overlays and the new injection point:

```
=== maestro-execute.md (1 overlay exists) ===

  <purpose>
  <required_reading>
  <context>
  <execution>
     ├─ [existing] cli-verify #1  "CLI Verification step"
     >>> NEW: append here (your overlay)
  <success_criteria>
```

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm:
- **"Confirm"** — proceed with this injection point
- **"Pick different section"** — re-select section/mode
- **"Cancel"** — abort

### 2.5. Skill chain configuration

After confirming the injection point, ask whether this overlay should chain to another skill upon completion. This enables the overlay's injected content to hand off to a skill via AskUserQuestion at runtime — similar to how `/maestro` chains commands via `Skill({ skill: "...", args: "..." })`.

Use AskUserQuestion:
- **"No chain"** — standard overlay, no skill handoff
- **"Chain to skill"** → ask for the target skill name (e.g., `quality-review`, `maestro-verify`, `quality-test`)
- **"Chain with alternatives"** → ask for primary skill + 1-2 alternative skills

If chain is selected, record the skill name(s) for use in Step 3.

### 3. Draft the overlay JSON

Build a slug from the user's intent (kebab-case, lowercase). Write to `~/.maestro/overlays/<slug>.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "<slug>",
  "description": "<short summary of what and why>",
  "targets": ["maestro-execute"],
  "priority": 50,
  "enabled": true,
  "patches": [
    {
      "section": "execution",
      "mode": "append",
      "content": "## CLI Verification (overlay)\n\nAfter execution, run:\n```\nccw cli -p \"PURPOSE: ...\" --mode analysis --rule analysis-review-code-quality\n```"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Content guidelines**
- Lead the injected block with a heading that includes `(overlay)` so readers see it's machine-injected
- Keep content concise — overlays should add a step, not rewrite the command
- `@~/.maestro/...` references are encouraged for pointing at docs
- Escape `\n` in JSON strings; use a HEREDOC via Bash if content is long

**Skill chain content** — if a chain was configured in Step 2.5, append a Skill Handoff block at the end of the patch `content`. The handoff uses AskUserQuestion so the user controls whether to proceed:

```markdown
---

**Skill Handoff** (overlay)

After the above step completes, use AskUserQuestion:
- "Proceed to /quality-review" — Hand off to quality review
- "Skip" — Continue with current command flow
- "Alternative: /maestro-verify" — Run verification instead

On user selection:
- Proceed → Skill({ skill: "quality-review", args: "{phase}" })
- Alternative → Skill({ skill: "maestro-verify", args: "{phase}" })
- Skip → continue normally
```

Handoff rules:
- Always include a **"Skip"** option — the user can always decline the chain
- Use `Skill({ skill: "<name>", args: "..." })` syntax consistent with maestro.md chainMap
- Mark handoff heading with `(overlay)` tag
- Support runtime variable placeholders: `{phase}`, `{description}`, `{session_id}`
- Keep handoff block under 10 lines of markdown

### 4. Install via `maestro overlay add`

Run:

```bash
maestro overlay add ~/.maestro/overlays/<slug>.json
```

This validates the overlay, copies it into place (idempotent), and applies it across all known install scopes. On validation failure, fix the JSON and re-run.

### 5. Report

Show the user:
- Path of the saved overlay JSON
- Which targets were patched and which were skipped (missing/disabled)
- Skill chain info (if configured)
- A reminder that `maestro install` will auto-reapply on every run
- How to remove: `maestro overlay remove <slug>`

**Report format**

```
=== OVERLAY INSTALLED ===
Name:    <slug>
Path:    ~/.maestro/overlays/<slug>.json
Targets: maestro-execute (applied), maestro-plan (skipped: missing)
Chain:   quality-review (via AskUserQuestion) | none
Scopes:  [global]

Re-apply: maestro overlay apply
Remove:   maestro overlay remove <slug>
Inspect:  maestro overlay list
```

After the report, remind the user they can run `maestro overlay list` for the interactive TUI showing section maps and overlay management.
