<purpose>
Generate missing automated tests for a phase based on gap analysis from maestro-verify (Nyquist audit) and quality-test (UAT coverage gaps). Bridges verification (finds MISSING coverage) and testing (runs UAT) by producing the automated tests that make Nyquist coverage pass. TDD/E2E classification, test discovery, plan approval, and RED-GREEN methodology defined in workflow test-gen.md.

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS (required -- phase number)

**Flags:**
- `--layer <unit|e2e|all>` -- Generate only specific test layer (default: all)

Context files:
- Phase artifacts (resolve via `state.json.artifacts[]` → scratch paths):
  - verification.json -- Nyquist gaps (MISSING/PARTIAL)
  - validation.json -- requirement-to-test mapping
  - .tests/coverage-report.json -- UAT coverage gaps
  - .summaries/TASK-*.md -- what was built
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/test-gen.md' completely.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- All tests pass → `/quality-test {phase}`
- Bugs discovered (failing tests) → `/quality-debug {phase}`
- Regressions in existing tests → `/quality-debug {phase}`
- Coverage still low → `/quality-test-gen {phase} --layer {missing_layer}`
</execution>

|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | Phase number required | Check arguments format, re-run with correct input |
| E002 | error | No verification results found (run maestro-verify first) | Check arguments format, re-run with correct input |
