<purpose>
Mark a milestone as complete after its audit has passed. Archives all scratch artifacts to `milestones/{M}/artifacts/`, moves artifact entries from `state.json.artifacts[]` to `milestone_history`, extracts final learnings, and advances to the next milestone.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
@~/.maestro/workflows/milestone-complete.md
</required_reading>

<context>
Milestone: $ARGUMENTS (optional -- defaults to current_milestone from state.json).

**Requires:** `/maestro-milestone-audit` should have passed.

**State files:**
- `.workflow/state.json` — artifacts[], milestones[], current_milestone, milestone_history[]
- `.workflow/roadmap.md` — milestone structure
- `.workflow/milestones/{milestone}/audit-report.md` — audit results
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/milestone-complete.md' completely.

Archive flow steps (validation, directory archival, artifact history, learning extraction, state advancement, cleanup) are defined in workflow `milestone-complete.md`.

### Knowledge Promotion Inquiry

After learning extraction (step 4), scan `learnings.md` for promotion candidates:

1. **High-frequency pattern detection**: Scan all `<spec-entry category="learning">` entries for keyword overlap (≥2 entries sharing keywords):
   → Ask: "Keyword '{keyword}' appears in {N} learning entries. Should this be promoted to a formal coding convention? (`/spec-add coding`)"

2. **Convention drift detection**: Compare executed task summaries against `coding-conventions.md` and `architecture-constraints.md`:
   → Ask: "Were any established conventions bypassed during this milestone? Should conventions be updated?"

3. **Wiki island check**: Auto-trigger `wiki-connect --fix` to link newly extracted knowledge.

If user confirms promotion, invoke `Skill({ skill: "spec-add", args: "<category> <content>" })` with promoted content, preserving original date and source traceability.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- Cut a release → `/maestro-milestone-release`
- Next milestone → `/maestro-analyze` or `/maestro-plan 1`
- View state → `/manage-status`
</execution>
