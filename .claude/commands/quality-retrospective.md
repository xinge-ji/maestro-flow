<purpose>
Post-execution multi-perspective retrospective (复盘) for completed phases. Consumes existing execution artifacts (verification.json, review.json, issues.jsonl, plan.json, .summaries/, uat.md, state.json) and runs four parallel lenses — technical, process, quality, decision — to distill reusable insights. Routes each insight into the appropriate store: spec stub for reusable patterns, memory tip for process notes, issue for recurring gaps. Auto-scans for unreviewed completed phases and reports the backlog. Every insight is also persisted to `.workflow/learning/lessons.jsonl` for cross-phase queryability.

Modes (scan/single/range/all), flags (--lens, --no-route, --compare, --auto-yes), and storage paths defined in workflow retrospective.md Argument Shape and Stages 1-7.
</context>

<execution>
Follow `~/.maestro/workflows/retrospective.md` Stages 1–8 in order. Key invariants:

1. **Read-only until Stage 6** — Stages 1–5 must not write anything except the in-memory retrospective record.
2. **Parallel lens dispatch** — Stage 4 spawns one Agent per active lens in a single message (multiple Agent tool calls). All agents use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and `run_in_background: false`.
3. **Match canonical issues schema** — Stage 6 issue routing must produce rows that pass `jq` parsing and match the schema in `workflows/issue.md` Step 4 exactly (status `"open"`, full `issue_history` entry, all required fields).
4. **Reuse `manage-learn tip` for note routing** — do not duplicate the learning pipeline; invoke via `Skill({ skill: "manage-learn", args: "tip ..." })`.
5. **Backward-compat with phase-transition** — append a one-line summary per insight to `.workflow/specs/learnings.md` if and only if that file already exists. Never create it.
6. **Stable insight IDs** — `INS-{8 hex}` from `hash(phase_num + lens + title)` so re-runs do not duplicate.
7. **Archive before overwrite** — if existing `retrospective.{md,json}` are being replaced, move them to `{artifact_dir}/.history/` with a timestamp suffix first.

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Mode correctly resolved (scan / single / range / all)
- [ ] At least one phase selected and validated (status == "completed", artifacts exist)
- [ ] All requested lens agents returned valid JSON, or W001 logged for partial coverage
- [ ] `retrospective.json` written with metrics, findings_by_lens, distilled_insights, routing_recommendations
- [ ] `retrospective.md` written and human-readable (tweetable, metrics table, per-lens findings, insights, routing table)
- [ ] Each insight has a stable `INS-{8hex}` id
- [ ] If routing enabled (default): every recommendation either created an artifact or was explicitly skipped by user
- [ ] Spec entries (if any) appended as `<spec-entry>` to matching `.workflow/specs/{category-file}.md`
- [ ] Issue rows (if any) match canonical issues.jsonl schema (status "open", full issue_history, all required fields)
- [ ] Note tips (if any) created via `Skill({ skill: "manage-learn", args: "tip ..." })`
- [ ] `lessons.jsonl` appended with one row per insight regardless of routing target
- [ ] `learning-index.json` updated and parseable
- [ ] No existing phase artifacts modified (verification.json, review.json, plan.json untouched)
- [ ] Confirmation banner displays routing counts and next-step suggestions
- [ ] Next step: `/manage-status` to review state, or `/manage-issue list --source retrospective` to triage created issues, or `/manage-learn list` to browse the lessons library
