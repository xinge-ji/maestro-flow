<purpose>
Incrementally refresh .workflow/codebase/ documentation based on changes since the last rebuild or refresh. Detects which files have changed (via git diff), identifies which codebase docs are affected, selectively re-runs mapper agents on those areas only, and updates timestamps. Much faster than a full rebuild for ongoing maintenance.

$ARGUMENTS -- optional flags.

**Flags:**
- `--since <date>` -- Override change detection window (ISO date or relative like "3d")
- `--deep` -- Force deeper re-scan even for files with minor changes

**State files:**
- `.workflow/` -- must be initialized
- `.workflow/codebase/` -- must contain existing docs (from prior rebuild)
- `.workflow/codebase/doc-index.json` -- documentation index with timestamps
- `.workflow/state.json` -- contains `codebase_last_rebuilt` timestamp

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Changed files detected via git diff since last refresh
- [ ] Affected documentation entries identified from doc-index.json
- [ ] Only affected docs refreshed (selective mapper re-run)
- [ ] doc-index.json timestamps updated per affected entry
- [ ] state.json updated with codebase_last_refreshed timestamp
- [ ] Next step routing: `/manage-status` or `/spec-load` to use updated docs
