<purpose>
Orchestrate all maestro commands automatically based on user intent and current project state.
Two routing modes:
1. **Intent-based**: User describes a goal → classify task type → select/compose command chain → confirm → execute
2. **State-based**: Read .workflow/state.json → determine next logical step → suggest/execute (triggered by `continue`/`next`)

For fuzzy intent, `maestro-discuss` acts as the bounded discussion gate before final routing.

Per-step execution engine (default: auto):
- **internal**: Execute via Skill() in current session — output visible in conversation, synchronous, user can intervene
- **CLI delegate**: Heavy execution steps — context isolation, template-driven prompts, gemini quality analysis

Produces session directory at `.workflow/.maestro/{session_id}/` with status.json tracking chain progress.
Executes commands sequentially with artifact propagation between steps.
</purpose>

<deferred_reading>
- [maestro.md](~/.maestro/workflows/maestro.md) — read at execution start (Steps 1-3: intent analysis, chain selection, session setup)
- [maestro-chain-execute.md](~/.maestro/workflows/maestro-chain-execute.md) — read when dispatching chain execution (Step 4) or resume mode
- [maestro-super.md](~/.maestro/workflows/maestro-super.md) — read when `--super` flag is active
</deferred_reading>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — user intent text, or special keywords.

**Special keywords:**
- `continue` / `next` / `go` — State-based routing: read state.json, determine next step, execute
- `status` — Shortcut to Skill({ skill: "manage-status" })

**Flags:**
- `-y` / `--yes` — Auto mode: skip the discussion gate, skip confirmation, auto-skip on errors. Propagates to downstream commands that support it.
- `-c` / `--continue` — Resume previous coordinator session from `.workflow/.maestro/*/status.json`
- `--dry-run` — Show planned chain without executing
- `--exec <mode>` — Execution engine: `auto` (default), `cli`, `internal`. `internal` = Skill() in current session; `cli` = delegate to external CLI. Auto selects per step based on command complexity.
- `--tool <name>` — CLI tool for delegate execution (default: claude). Only used when engine=cli.
- `--super` — Super mode: deliver production-ready complete software system. See Super Mode section below.

**State files read:**
- `.workflow/state.json` — project state machine + artifact registry
- `.workflow/roadmap.md` — milestone/phase structure
- `.workflow/scratch/*/plan.json` — plan metadata (via artifact registry paths)
</context>

<execution>
**Resume mode (`-c`):** Skip selection workflow entirely — scan `.workflow/.maestro/` for latest session, then read `~/.maestro/workflows/maestro-chain-execute.md` and follow it with `$SESSION_PATH` = discovered session path. **End.**

**Normal mode:** Read `~/.maestro/workflows/maestro.md` from deferred_reading, then follow it completely.

**Auto mode (`-y`) propagation:**

When `-y` is active, maestro propagates auto flags to downstream commands. Only commands that explicitly support auto mode receive the flag — others execute normally (no forced flags).

| Command | Auto Flag | Effect |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| maestro-analyze | `-y` | Skip interactive scoping, auto-deepen |
| maestro-discuss | `-y` | Skip interactive questions, use heuristics |
| maestro-brainstorm | `-y` | Skip interactive questions, use defaults |
| maestro-roadmap | `-y` | Skip interactive questions, use defaults (create/revise/review) |
| maestro-ui-design | `-y` | Skip interactive selection, pick top variant |
| maestro-plan | `--auto` | Skip interactive clarification |
| maestro-roadmap --mode full | `-y` | Skip interactive questions, use defaults |
| maestro-execute | *(none)* | No auto flag — executes all tasks normally |
| maestro-verify | *(none)* | No auto flag — runs full verification |
| quality-review | *(none)* | No auto flag — auto-detects level, runs fully |
| quality-test | `--auto-fix` | Auto-trigger gap-fix loop on failures |
| quality-test-gen | *(none)* | No auto flag — generates tests normally |
| quality-debug | *(none)* | No auto flag — runs diagnosis normally |
| quality-retrospective | `--auto-yes` | Accept all routing recommendations (spec/note/issue) without prompting |
| maestro-milestone-audit | *(none)* | No auto flag — validates milestone readiness |
| manage-learn | *(none)* | No auto flag — pure file operation, no prompts |

Commands not listed (manage-*, spec-*, milestone-*) have no auto flags and execute as-is.

In auto mode, maestro also:
- Skips the `maestro-discuss` gate (workflow Step 2d)
- Skips chain confirmation (workflow Step 3d)
- Auto-skips on step errors (retry once, then skip and continue)

**Super mode (`--super`):** Read `maestro-super.md` from deferred_reading, then follow it completely.

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Description | Recovery |
|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| E001 | error | No intent and project not initialized | Prompt for intent or suggest maestro-init |
| E002 | error | Discussion gate could not resolve after 2 rounds | Show parsed intent, ask user to rephrase |
| E003 | error | Chain step failed + user chose abort | Record partial progress, suggest resume with -c |
| E004 | error | Resume session not found | Show available sessions |
| W001 | warning | Intent ambiguous, multiple chains possible | Present options, let user choose |
| W002 | warning | Chain step completed with warnings | Log and continue |
| W003 | warning | State suggests different chain than intent | Show discrepancy, let user decide |
