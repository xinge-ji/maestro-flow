<purpose>
Knowledge graph link discovery and health improvement. Analyzes the wiki index to find orphaned entries, missing connections, and transitive link gaps, then suggests or auto-applies new `related` links to improve graph connectivity.

Leverages maestro's unique wiki graph infrastructure (BM25 search, backlinks, health scoring) — no equivalent in gstack. Directly improves the quality of all downstream wiki consumers (search, digest, follow-along).
</purpose>

<context>
Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Flags, storage paths, and CLI commands defined in workflow wiki-connect.md.
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/wiki-connect.md' completely (Stages 1-6).

**Next-step routing:**
- Generate knowledge digest → `/wiki-digest <topic>`
- Follow-along on orphan → `/learn-follow <wiki-id>`
- View full graph → `maestro wiki graph`
</execution>

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Condition | Recovery |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | No wiki entries found (empty index) | Initialize wiki content first, or run `/maestro-init` |
| E002 | error | `maestro wiki` CLI not available | Check maestro installation |
| W001 | warning | No connection candidates found above threshold | Lower --min-similarity or check if graph is already well-connected |
| W002 | warning | Some wiki update calls failed during --fix | Partial application; retry failed entries manually |
| W003 | warning | Health score unchanged after fix | Connections may not have improved the specific health metrics |
