<purpose>
Execute all tasks in a plan using wave-based parallel execution with dependency-aware ordering. Each plan is executed independently (plans串行, plan内wave并行). Task summaries are written to the plan's scratch directory under `.summaries/`. Registers EXC artifact in state.json.

Invoked after /maestro-plan produces a confirmed plan. When called without args on a milestone, finds all pending plans and executes them sequentially.

<deferred_reading>
- [task.json](~/.maestro/templates/task.json) — read when reading task definitions
- [state.json](~/.maestro/templates/state.json) — read when registering artifact

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — phase number, or no args for milestone-wide execution, with optional flags.

Scope routing, flags, resolution logic, output directory format, artifact registration schema, and incremental learning extraction are defined in workflow `execute.md`.

### Pre-flight: team conflict check

Before any task execution, run:
```
Bash("maestro collab preflight --phase <phase-number>")
```
If exit code is 1, present warnings and ask whether to proceed.

Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/execute.md' completely.

### Post-task Knowledge Inquiry

After each task completes, evaluate inquiry triggers:

1. **Execution deviation**: If task summary mentions approach change, dependency swap, or plan deviation:
   → Ask: "TASK-{NNN} deviated from the plan. Should this decision be recorded as an architecture constraint? (`/spec-add arch`)"

2. **Retry success**: If task required ≥2 retries before completion:
   → Ask: "TASK-{NNN} succeeded after {N} retries. Should this fix pattern be documented? (`/spec-add debug`)"

3. **Implicit knowledge**: If task summary contains design rationale ("chose X because", "rejected Y due to"):
   → Ask: "Design decision detected. Should it be recorded as a learning? (`/spec-add learning`)"

If user confirms, invoke `Skill({ skill: "spec-add", args: "<category> <content>" })` with extracted content.

### Issue Status Sync

On each task completion, if `task.issue_id` exists, sync status back to the issue in `.workflow/issues/issues.jsonl`:

```
For each completed/failed TASK with issue_id:
  Read issue from issues.jsonl by issue_id
  Collect all task_refs[] statuses for that issue:
    all task_refs completed → issue.status = "resolved"
    any task_ref failed    → issue.status = "in_progress"
  Append history entry: { action: "executed", at: <ISO>, by: "maestro-execute", summary: "TASK-{NNN} {status}" }
  Write updated issue back to issues.jsonl
```

**Report format on completion:**

```
=== EXECUTION COMPLETE ===
Plans executed: {plans_count}
Completed: {completed_count}/{total_count} tasks
Failed:    {failed_count} tasks

Summaries: {plan_dir}/.summaries/
Tasks:     {plan_dir}/.task/

Next steps:
  /maestro-verify              -- Verify execution results
  /maestro-verify --dir {dir}  -- Verify specific plan
  /manage-status               -- View project dashboard
```

If failed tasks exist, suggest /quality-debug for investigation.
