<purpose>
Unified roadmap generation with two execution paths:

- **Light mode** (default): Directly from requirements to roadmap. No specification documents.
- **Full mode** (`--mode full`): 7-phase document chain (Product Brief → PRD → Architecture → Epics → Roadmap) producing a complete specification package in `.workflow/.spec/` plus `.workflow/roadmap.md`.

Additional operation modes (light mode only):
- **Revise** (`--revise`): Modify existing roadmap while preserving completed phase progress
- **Review** (`--review`): Health assessment of current roadmap (read-only)

Both modes produce `.workflow/roadmap.md` with milestone/phase structure ready for maestro-plan.

- [roadmap.md](~/.maestro/workflows/roadmap.md) — read when mode is light (default)
- [spec-generate.md](~/.maestro/workflows/spec-generate.md) — read when mode is full
- [spec-config.json](~/.maestro/templates/spec-config.json) — read when initializing spec configuration (full mode)

<context>
$ARGUMENTS -- requirement text, @file reference, or brainstorm session reference.

**Flags (shared):**
- `--mode light|full`: Execution path (default: light)
- `-y` / `--yes`: Auto mode — skip interactive questions, use recommended defaults
- `-c` / `--continue`: Resume from last checkpoint
- `--from-brainstorm SESSION-ID`: Import guidance-specification.md from a brainstorm session as seed

**Flags (light mode only):**
- `-m progressive|direct|auto`: Decomposition strategy (default: auto)
- `--revise [instructions]`: Revise existing roadmap. If instructions provided, apply directly. If omitted, ask user. Preserves completed phase progress.
- `--review`: Roadmap health assessment (read-only)

**Input types:**
- Direct text: `"Implement user authentication system with OAuth and 2FA"`
- File reference: `@requirements.md`
- Brainstorm import: `--from-brainstorm WFS-xxx`
- No args + `--revise` / `--review`: Operate on existing `.workflow/roadmap.md`

**Pipeline position:**
```
maestro-brainstorm (optional upstream)
        ↓ guidance-specification.md
maestro-init (project setup)
        ↓ project.md, state.json, config.json
maestro-roadmap [--mode light]     → roadmap.md directly
maestro-roadmap --mode full        → spec package + roadmap.md
        ↓
maestro-plan → maestro-execute → maestro-verify
```

**Note (full mode):** `maestro-init` MUST run before `--mode full`. It creates the `.workflow/` directory and project context.
</context>

<execution>

### Mode routing

1. Read `@~/.maestro/workflows/roadmap-common.md` (always — shared logic)
2. Parse `--mode` flag:
   - `light` or omitted → read `@~/.maestro/workflows/roadmap.md`, follow its process
   - `full` → read `@~/.maestro/workflows/spec-generate.md`, follow its process
3. If `--revise` or `--review` present → force light mode (these are light-mode-only operations)

### Light mode (default)

Follow `~/.maestro/workflows/roadmap.md` completely.

Sub-modes:
- **Create** (default): Build roadmap from requirements
- **Revise** (`--revise`): Follow workflow roadmap.md "Mode: Revise" section
- **Review** (`--review`): Follow workflow roadmap.md "Mode: Review" section

### Full mode (`--mode full`)

Follow `~/.maestro/workflows/spec-generate.md` completely.

### Next-step routing on completion
