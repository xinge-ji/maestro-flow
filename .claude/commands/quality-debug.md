<purpose>
Debug issues using scientific method with subagent isolation and persistent debug state. Three entry modes (standalone, from-UAT, parallel) and structured root cause collection with UAT feedback loop. Full algorithm defined in workflow debug.md.

User's issue: $ARGUMENTS

**Flags:**
- `--from-uat <phase>` -- Read gaps from phase's uat.md as pre-filled symptoms
- `--parallel` -- Spawn parallel debug agents (one per gap cluster)

**All context via state.json.artifacts[]:**

```
related = artifacts.filter(a =>
  a.phase === target_phase && a.milestone === current_milestone
).sort_by(completed_at asc)
```

Each artifact's type determines its outputs at `.workflow/{a.path}/`:
- **execute** → .summaries/, .task/ (source of code changes)
- **review** → review.json (findings guide hypothesis formation)
- **debug** → understanding.md, evidence.ndjson (prior investigations, avoid re-investigation)
- **test** → uat.md (--from-uat gap source), .tests/

Extract conclusions from related artifacts that may affect this debug session — review findings guide investigation direction, prior debug avoids redundant work.

**Output**: `DEBUG_DIR = .workflow/scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-debug-P{N}-{slug}/` (P{N} = phase number when phase-scoped; omit for standalone). Output directory rules defined in workflow debug.md Step 4.
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/debug.md' completely.

**Register artifact on completion (phase-scoped only):**
```
Append to state.json.artifacts[]:
{
  id: nextArtifactId(artifacts, "debug"),  // DBG-001
  type: "debug",
  milestone: current_milestone,
  phase: target_phase,
  scope: "phase",
  path: "scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-debug-P{N}-{slug}",
  status: all_diagnosed ? "completed" : "failed",
  depends_on: triggering_review_id || exec_art.id,
  harvested: false,
  created_at: start_time,
  completed_at: now()
}
```

### Post-debug Knowledge Inquiry

After root cause is confirmed, evaluate inquiry triggers:

1. **Recurring pattern**: If root cause matches a recurring pattern (similar to prior debug sessions):
   → Ask: "This root cause pattern has appeared before. Should it be documented in `debug-notes.md` to prevent recurrence? (`/spec-add debug`)"

2. **Non-obvious fix**: If fix involved a non-obvious approach or workaround:
   → Ask: "This fix used a non-obvious strategy. Should it be recorded as a learning? (`/spec-add learning`)"

3. **Architectural gap**: If root cause traces to architectural boundary violation or missing constraint:
   → Ask: "Root cause points to an architectural gap. Should `architecture-constraints.md` be updated? (`/spec-add arch`)"

If user confirms, invoke `Skill({ skill: "spec-add", args: "<category> <content>" })`.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- Root cause found, fix needed → `/maestro-plan {phase} --gaps`
- Root cause found (from UAT), auto-fix → `/quality-test {phase} --auto-fix`
- Inconclusive, need more info → `/quality-debug {issue} -c` (resume session)
- Standalone fix already applied → `/maestro-verify {phase}`
