<purpose>
Unified wiki graph management command. Provides interactive access to wiki health monitoring, entry search, orphan cleanup, and graph statistics — the day-to-day operations that keep the knowledge graph healthy.

Complements `/wiki-connect` (link discovery) and `/wiki-digest` (synthesis) with operational tooling.
