<purpose>
Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with workflow guarantees (atomic commits, state tracking) using a shortened pipeline. Invoked for tasks that are well-understood and do not require full phase-level planning. Produces scratch task directory with plan, execution results, and optional verification. Flags --discuss and --full enable additional pipeline stages.

$ARGUMENTS

Parse for:
- `--full` flag -- Enables plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification
- `--discuss` flag -- Decision extraction before planning (gray areas, Locked/Free/Deferred classification)
- Remaining text as task description
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/quick.md' completely.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- Task done, --full verification passed → /manage-status
- Task done, verification found gaps → /quality-debug {issue}
- Task done, want to sync docs → /quality-sync
- Need a full phase workflow instead → /maestro-plan {phase}
</execution>
