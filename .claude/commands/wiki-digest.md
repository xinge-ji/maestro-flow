<purpose>
Knowledge synthesis command that generates actionable digests from the wiki knowledge graph. Clusters entries by semantic theme, identifies knowledge gaps, and produces a coverage heatmap. Unique to maestro — leverages the wiki graph (BM25 search, backlinks, health) to surface trends and missing knowledge.

Unlike `maestro wiki list` which shows raw entries, this command synthesizes and interprets the knowledge base, producing a curated summary with gap analysis and recommended next actions.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Flags, scope resolution, storage paths, and CLI commands defined in workflow wiki-digest.md.
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/wiki-digest.md' completely (Stages 1-8).

**Next-step routing:**
- Deep dive on a theme → `/learn-follow <wiki-id>`
- Fix graph gaps → `/wiki-connect --fix`
- Decompose code for missing patterns → `/learn-decompose <path>`
- Create missing entries → `maestro wiki create --type <type> --slug <slug>`
- Triage gap issues → `/manage-issue list --source wiki-digest`
</execution>

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Condition | Recovery |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | No wiki entries found (empty index) | Initialize wiki content first |
| E002 | error | Topic search returned 0 results | Broaden topic or check wiki content |
| W001 | warning | Too few entries (<5) for meaningful theme clustering | Digest produced but themes may be trivial |
| W002 | warning | lessons.jsonl not found — skipping cross-reference | Proceed without lesson context |
| W003 | warning | Some entry bodies failed to load — partial summaries | Note incomplete entries in digest |
