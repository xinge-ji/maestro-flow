<purpose>
Perform multi-dimensional analysis of a technical proposal, decision, or architecture choice through iterative CLI-assisted exploration and interactive discussion. Produces a discussion timeline (discussion.md) with evolving understanding, multi-perspective findings, Decision Recording Protocol, Intent Coverage tracking, and a final conclusions package with Go/No-Go recommendation.

Combines structured 6-dimension scoring with iterative deepening and decision extraction. Replaces both analysis and decision-capture workflows — produces analysis.md (scoring) AND context.md (Locked/Free/Deferred decisions for plan).

Use `-q` for quick decision extraction only (skip exploration + scoring).

Use `--gaps` for issue-focused root cause analysis (replaces manage-issue-analyze). Loads issues from issues.jsonl, performs CLI exploration against issue context/location, synthesizes root cause into issue.analysis, and outputs context.md for downstream `plan --gaps`.

<context>
$ARGUMENTS -- phase number for milestone-scoped, topic text for adhoc/standalone mode, no args for milestone-wide.

**Flags:**
- `-y` / `--yes`: Auto mode — skip interactive scoping, use recommended defaults, auto-deepen
- `-c` / `--continue`: Resume from existing session (auto-detect session folder + discussion.md)
- `-q` / `--quick`: Quick mode — skip exploration + scoring, go straight to decision extraction (context.md only)
- `--gaps [ISS-ID]`: Issue root cause analysis mode. If ISS-ID provided, analyze single issue. If omitted, analyze all open/registered issues from issues.jsonl.

Scope routing, output directory format, artifact registration schema, and output artifact listing are defined in workflow analyze.md (Scope Routing and Output Structure sections).

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/analyze.md' completely.

### --gaps Mode (Issue Root Cause Analysis)

When `--gaps` flag is present, follow `~/.maestro/workflows/issue-gaps-analyze.md` instead of the standard analyze pipeline:

```
Phase 1: Load issues from .workflow/issues/issues.jsonl
  - If ISS-ID provided: load single issue
  - If no ISS-ID: filter issues where status = open | registered
  - Validate: at least 1 issue loaded, else error E_NO_ISSUES

Phase 2: CLI exploration per issue
  - For each issue: build exploration prompt from issue.title, description, context, related_files
  - Run maestro delegate --role analyze --mode analysis with codebase context
  - Gather affected files, call chains, root cause evidence

Phase 3: Root cause synthesis → write issue.analysis
  - Parse CLI output into analysis record: { root_cause, affected_files, impact_scope, fix_direction, confidence, analyzed_at, tool, depth }
  - Write analysis record to issue in issues.jsonl
  - Append history entry: { action: "analyzed", at: <ISO>, by: "maestro-analyze --gaps" }

Phase 4: Output context.md for downstream plan --gaps
  - Aggregate all analyzed issues into context.md with root causes and fix directions
  - Register ANL artifact in state.json
```

**Handoff:** context.md is consumed by maestro-plan (loads Locked/Free/Deferred decisions). In --gaps mode, context.md contains issue root causes for `plan --gaps` consumption.

**Next-step routing on completion:**

Phase/Milestone scope:
- Go recommendation, UI work needed → `/maestro-ui-design {phase}`
- Go recommendation, ready to plan → `/maestro-plan` or `/maestro-plan {phase}`
- No-Go recommendation → revisit requirements or `/maestro-brainstorm {topic}`

Adhoc/Standalone scope:
- Ready to plan → `/maestro-plan --dir {scratch_dir}`
- Need more exploration → `/maestro-analyze {topic} -c`

Gaps scope:
- Issues analyzed → `/maestro-plan --gaps` (plan fix tasks linked to issues)
- Need more context → `/maestro-analyze --gaps {ISS-ID}` (re-analyze specific issue)
</execution>

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Condition | Recovery |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | No args and no roadmap (cannot determine scope) | Prompt user for topic text or create roadmap first |
| W001 | warning | CLI exploration failed | Continue with available context, note limitation |
| W002 | warning | CLI analysis timeout | Retry with shorter prompt, or skip perspective |
| W003 | warning | Insufficient evidence for scoring dimensions | Note low-confidence dimensions, proceed with available evidence |
| W004 | warning | Max rounds reached (5) | Force synthesis, offer continuation option |
| E_NO_ISSUES | error | --gaps but no open/registered issues found | Suggest `/manage-issue-discover` or `/manage-issue create` |
| E_ISSUE_NOT_FOUND | error | --gaps with ISS-ID but issue not found | Suggest `/manage-issue list` to find valid IDs |
