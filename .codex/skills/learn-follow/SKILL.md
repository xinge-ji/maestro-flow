<purpose>
Guided reading experience for code files, wiki entries, or topics. Walks through content
section by section using 4 forcing questions to extract patterns, identify assumptions,
and build a structured understanding map. Insights persist to `lessons.jsonl`.

Unlike `learn-decompose` which is parallel pattern extraction, this is sequential
deep reading that builds understanding incrementally.

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — target and optional flags.

**Target resolution (auto-detected):**
- File path → Read source file
- Wiki ID (`type-slug`) → Fetch via `maestro wiki get`
- Topic string → Search via `maestro wiki search`, use top result

**Flags:**
- `--depth shallow` — Key patterns and structure only (default)
- `--depth deep` — Every function, branch, assumption
- `--save-wiki` — Create wiki note with reading notes

**Output**: `.workflow/learning/follow-{slug}-{date}.md`
</context>

<execution>

### Stage 1: Resolve Target + Load Context Web
- File: verify exists, parse imports for dependency files
- Wiki ID: fetch + load forward/backlinks
- Topic: search wiki, take top result
- Build 1-hop context neighborhood (imports/exports or wiki links)

### Stage 2: Build Reading Order
- Single file: split into logical sections (function/class boundaries)
- Directory: entry point → core modules → utilities → tests
- `--depth shallow`: top-level structure only
- `--depth deep`: every function body, every branch

### Stage 3: Guided Reading (4 Forcing Questions per Section)
1. **"What pattern is being used here?"** — design patterns, idioms, conventions
2. **"Why this approach instead of alternatives?"** — trade-offs made
3. **"What assumption does this depend on?"** — external state, input shape, ordering
4. **"What would break if this changed?"** — fragility, downstream effects

### Stage 4: Extract Patterns + Produce Understanding Map
From forcing question answers, extract: design patterns (with file:line anchors), naming conventions, error handling approach, data flow, assumptions.

Cross-reference against `coding-conventions.md`: documented vs undocumented patterns.

### Stage 5: Persist
1. Write `follow-{slug}-{date}.md` with understanding map
2. Append new patterns to `lessons.jsonl` (source: "follow", stable INS-ids)
3. If `--save-wiki`: create wiki note entry

**Next steps:** `/learn-decompose <path>`, `/spec-add coding ...`, `/learn-second-opinion <file>`
