description: Tiered code review via CSV wave pipeline. Decomposes into 6 dimension agents running in parallel, with optional deep-dive aggregation wave. Replaces quality-review command.

<purpose>
Wave-based multi-dimensional code review using `spawn_agents_on_csv`. Decomposes review into independent dimension agents (Wave 1), then aggregates findings into a unified report with verdict (Wave 2).

**Core workflow**: Collect Files -> Decompose Dimensions -> Parallel Review -> Aggregate + Verdict

### Per-Wave CSV (Temporary)

Each wave generates `wave-{N}.csv` with extra `prev_context` column.

### Output Artifacts

| File | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `tasks.csv` | Master state -- all tasks with status/findings | Updated after each wave |
| `wave-{N}.csv` | Per-wave input (temporary) | Created before wave, deleted after |
| `results.csv` | Final export of all task results | Created in Phase 3 |
| `discoveries.ndjson` | Shared exploration board | Append-only, carries across waves |
| `context.md` | Human-readable review report | Created in Phase 3 |
| `review.json` | Structured review output for downstream | Created in Phase 3 |

### Session Structure

```
.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-review-P{N}-{slug}/
+-- tasks.csv
+-- results.csv
+-- discoveries.ndjson
+-- context.md
+-- review.json
+-- wave-{N}.csv (temporary)
```
</csv_schema>

<invariants>
1. **Start Immediately**: First action is session initialization, then Phase 1
2. **Wave Order is Sacred**: Never execute wave 2 before wave 1 completes and results are merged
3. **CSV is Source of Truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state
4. **Context Propagation**: prev_context built from master CSV, not from memory
5. **Discovery Board is Append-Only**: Never clear, modify, or recreate discoveries.ndjson
6. **Skip on Failure**: If all dimension agents failed, skip aggregation
7. **Cleanup Temp Files**: Remove wave-{N}.csv after results are merged
8. **DO NOT STOP**: Continuous execution until all waves complete
</invariants>

<execution>

### Session Initialization

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract:
- `AUTO_YES` from `--yes` / `-y`
- `continueMode` from `--continue`
- `maxConcurrency` from `--concurrency N` / `-c N` (default: 6)
- `levelMatch` from `--level quick|standard|deep`
- `dimsMatch` from `--dimensions <list>`
- `phaseArg` = remaining text after stripping all flags

Session ID: `{YYYYMMDD}-review-P{phaseArg}-{phaseSlug}` (phaseSlug from index.json or roadmap)
Session folder: `.workflow/.csv-wave/{sessionId}/` — create via `mkdir -p`

### Phase 1: Phase Resolution -> CSV

**Objective**: Resolve phase, collect changed files, determine review level, generate tasks.csv.

**Decomposition Rules**:

1. **Phase resolution**: Resolve `{phaseArg}` via `state.json` artifact registry to `.workflow/scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-{type}-{slug}/`
2. **Related session discovery**: Query `state.json.artifacts[]` for matching phase + milestone. Extract prior quality context (verdicts, root causes, UAT gaps) from artifact outputs by type (execute → .summaries/.task/, review → review.json, debug → understanding.md, test → uat.md)
3. **File collection**: Read `.task/TASK-*.json` → collect `files[].path` where action != "read"
4. **Level detection**:

| Condition | Level |
|-----------|-------|
| `--level` flag provided | Use explicit level |
| <=3 changed files | quick |
| 4-19 changed files | standard |
| >=20 files OR phase marked critical | deep |

5. **Dimension selection**:

| Level | Dimensions |
|-------|------------|
| quick | correctness, security |
| standard | correctness, security, performance, architecture, maintainability, best-practices |
| deep | all 6 + forced deep-dive in aggregation |

If `--dimensions` flag provided, override with explicit list.

6. **Specs loading**: Read `.workflow/specs/` for project conventions (unless `--skip-specs`)
7. **CSV generation**: One row per dimension + one aggregation row

**Wave computation**: Simple 2-wave -- all dimension tasks = wave 1, aggregation = wave 2.

**User validation**: Display task breakdown (skip if AUTO_YES).

### Phase 2: Wave Execution Engine

**Objective**: Execute dimension reviews wave-by-wave via spawn_agents_on_csv.

#### Wave 1: Dimension Reviews (Parallel)

Filter master `tasks.csv` for `wave == 1 AND status == pending` → write `wave-1.csv` (no prev_context needed).

```javascript
spawn_agents_on_csv({
  csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1.csv`,
  id_column: "id",
  instruction: buildReviewInstruction(sessionFolder),
  max_concurrency: maxConcurrency,
  max_runtime_seconds: 3600,
  output_csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1-results.csv`,
  output_schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      id: { type: "string" },
      status: { type: "string", enum: ["completed", "failed"] },
      findings: { type: "string" },
      severity_counts: { type: "string" },
      top_issues: { type: "string" },
      error: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["id", "status", "findings"]
  }
})
```

Merge `wave-1-results.csv` into master `tasks.csv`, delete `wave-1.csv`.

#### Wave 2: Aggregation + Deep-Dive

Filter master `tasks.csv` for `wave == 2 AND status == pending`. If all wave 1 tasks failed, skip aggregation.

Build `prev_context` from wave 1 findings (format: `[Task N: Title] summary...` per task).
Write `wave-2.csv` with `prev_context` column → execute `spawn_agents_on_csv` → merge results → delete `wave-2.csv`.

### Phase 3: Results Aggregation

**Objective**: Generate final results and human-readable report.

Export master `tasks.csv` as `results.csv`. Build `review.json`:

```json
{
  "phase": "<phase>",
  "level": "<level>",
  "verdict": "PASS|WARN|BLOCK",
  "severity_distribution": { "critical": 0, "high": 0, "medium": 0, "low": 0 },
  "dimensions": [
    { "dimension": "correctness", "status": "completed", "severity_counts": {...}, "top_issues": [...] }
  ],
  "deep_dive": { "performed": true/false, "iterations": N, "impact_analysis": "..." },
  "issues_created": [],
  "timestamp": "<ISO>"
}
```

Generate `context.md`:

```markdown
# Code Review Report -- Phase {phase}

## Summary
- Level: {level}
- Files reviewed: {file_count}
- Dimensions: {dimension_count}
- Verdict: **{verdict}**

## Severity Distribution
| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | {N} |
| High     | {N} |
| Medium   | {N} |
| Low      | {N} |

## Dimension Results
### {dimension_name}
{findings}

**Top Issues:**
{top_issues}

## Deep-Dive Analysis
{if performed: impact analysis results}

## Issues Created
{list of created issue IDs}
```

**Verdict determination**:

| Condition | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|
| Any critical findings | BLOCK |
| High findings > 3 | BLOCK |
| Any high findings | WARN |
| Medium findings > 5 | WARN |
| Otherwise | PASS |

**Issue creation** by level threshold:

| Level | Create Issues For |
|-------|------------------|
| quick | critical only |
| standard | critical + high |
| deep | critical + high + medium |

**Phase index update**: Update `{artifact_dir}/index.json` with review status.

**Register artifact**: Append to `state.json.artifacts[]` with `type: "review"`, `id: REV-NNN`, `path: "scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-review-P{N}-{slug}"`, `depends_on: exec_art.id`. Output directory is independent scratch, not shared with plan.

Display summary.

### Shared Discovery Board Protocol

#### Standard Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `code_pattern` | `data.name` | `{name, file, description}` | Reusable code pattern found |
| `integration_point` | `data.file` | `{file, description, exports[]}` | Module connection point |
| `convention` | singleton | `{naming, imports, formatting}` | Project code conventions |
| `blocker` | `data.issue` | `{issue, severity, impact}` | Blocking issue found |
| `tech_stack` | singleton | `{framework, language, tools[]}` | Technology stack info |

#### Domain Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `vulnerability` | `data.location` | `{location, type, severity, cwe}` | Security vulnerability |
| `code_smell` | `data.location` | `{location, type, severity, description}` | Code quality issue |
| `performance_hotspot` | `data.location` | `{location, type, impact}` | Performance issue |

```bash
echo '{"ts":"<ISO>","worker":"{id}","type":"vulnerability","data":{"location":"src/auth/login.ts:42","type":"sql_injection","severity":"critical","cwe":"CWE-89"}}' >> {session_folder}/discoveries.ndjson
```
