<purpose>
Merge a completed milestone worktree branch back into main, sync scratch artifacts,
and reconcile artifact registry. Two-phase approach: git merge first (source code),
artifact sync second (only after git succeeds). Prevents partial state corruption
when merge conflicts occur.

$ARGUMENTS — milestone number and optional flags.

**Flags:**
- `-m <N>` or bare `<N>`: Milestone number
- `--force`: Merge even if milestone has incomplete artifacts
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be merged
- `--no-cleanup`: Keep worktree and branch after merge
- `--continue`: Resume merge paused due to git conflict

**Merge sequence:**
1. Registry health check → 2. Milestone artifact completeness validation →
3. Pre-merge rebase → 4. Git merge (source) → 5. Scratch artifact sync →
6. Artifact registry reconciliation → 7. Cleanup

**Phase 2 detail:**
- Copy worktree `scratch/*` to main `.workflow/scratch/`
- Merge `state.json.artifacts[]` entries (worktree wins for same id)
- Remove milestone `"forked"` flag in main state.json

Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/merge.md' completely.

| Code | Severity | Condition | Recovery |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | Running inside a worktree | Run from main worktree |
| E002 | error | No worktree registry found | Nothing to merge |
| E003 | error | --continue but no merge state | Start fresh merge |
| E004 | error | No milestone number | Provide `-m <N>` |
| W001 | warning | Stale registry entries | Auto-cleaned |
| W002 | warning | Incomplete artifacts without --force | Confirm or use --force |
| W003 | warning | Conflict pulling main into worktree | Resolve first |
