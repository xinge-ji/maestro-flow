<purpose>
Conversational UAT: present expected behavior one test at a time, user confirms or describes issues. Severity inferred from natural language (never asked). Session persists in `uat.md` across context resets. Failed tests trigger parallel debug agent diagnosis and optional gap-fix closure.

**Philosophy**: Show expected, ask if reality matches.
</purpose>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS -- phase number or scratch task ID, plus optional flags.

**Usage**:

```bash
$quality-test "3"                    # test phase 3
$quality-test "3 --smoke"            # smoke tests first, then UAT
$quality-test "3 --auto-fix"         # auto-trigger gap-fix loop on failures
$quality-test "--session 04-comments"  # resume specific session
```

**Flags**:
- `<phase>`: Phase number or scratch task ID
- `--smoke`: Run cold-start smoke tests before UAT
- `--auto-fix`: Auto-trigger gap-fix loop (plan --gaps -> execute -> re-verify) on failures
- `--session ID`: Resume a specific UAT session

No auto mode -- UAT is inherently interactive. `--auto-fix` only automates gap closure, not test execution.

**Output**: `{target_dir}/uat.md` + `.tests/test-plan.json` + `.tests/test-results.json` + `.tests/coverage-report.json`
</context>

<invariants>
1. **One test at a time** -- never batch-present tests
2. **Never ask severity** -- always infer from natural language
3. **Session persistence** -- uat.md survives context resets, resume from any point
4. **Batched writes** -- minimize file I/O (on issue, every 5 passes, completion)
5. **Gap-fix loop max 2 iterations** -- prevent infinite loops
6. **Agent calls use `run_in_background: false`** for synchronous execution
7. **Auto-create issues** in `.workflow/issues/issues.jsonl` for every failed test
</invariants>

<execution>

### Step 1: Resolve Target

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for phase number, scratch task ID, or flags
2. **Phase mode**: resolve `PHASE_DIR` via artifact registry in `state.json` to `.workflow/scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-{type}-{slug}/`
3. **Scratch mode**: set `SCRATCH_DIR = .workflow/scratch/{id}/`
4. Validate target exists and has `verification.json` -- if missing: **E002**

### Step 2: Check Active Sessions

Scan `.workflow/scratch` and `.workflow/phases` for existing `uat.md` files.

- If active sessions exist and no target specified: display session table, ask user to resume or start new
- If `--session ID` specified: resume that session directly (skip to Step 9)
- If session exists for target: offer resume or restart

### Step 3: Smoke Tests (if --smoke)

Run basic sanity checks (app starts, routes respond, build clean, deps installed).
If any smoke fails: **E003** -- abort, suggest Skill({ skill: "quality-debug" })

### Step 4: Load Verification Context

Read from target directory (resolved via artifact registry): verification.json, validation.json, index.json, plan.json, `.summaries/TASK-*.md`. Build testable list from user-observable outcomes.

### Step 4.5: Load Quality Context

Query `state.json.artifacts[]` for all artifacts matching `phase === target_phase && milestone === current_milestone`. Each artifact's type determines its outputs: review → review.json (findings become additional test scenarios), debug → understanding.md (confirmed root causes become regression tests). Extract conclusions that may affect test scenario design.

### Step 5: Design Test Scenarios

Create scenarios from testables (id T-001, name, category, expected behavior, requirement_ref). Focus on USER-OBSERVABLE outcomes. Write `{target_dir}/.tests/test-plan.json`.

### Step 6: Create UAT File

Archive previous `uat.md` to `.history/` if exists.
Write `{target_dir}/uat.md` with frontmatter (status, target, started), Current Test section, Tests section (all pending), Summary counters, empty Gaps section.

### Step 7: Present Test (Interactive Loop)

Present one test at a time: show `TEST {number}/{total}: {name}`, expected behavior, then prompt user to type "pass" or describe what is wrong. Wait for user response (plain text).

### Step 8: Process Response

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| empty, "yes", "y", "ok", "pass", "next" | Mark as pass |
| "skip", "can't test", "n/a" | Mark as skipped |
| Anything else | Log as issue, infer severity |

**Severity inference** (never ask):
- "crashes", "error", "fails completely" -> blocker
- "doesn't work", "wrong behavior", "broken" -> major
- "works but...", "slow", "minor issue" -> minor
- "color", "spacing", "typo" -> cosmetic
- Default: major

**On issue**: auto-create issue in `.workflow/issues/issues.jsonl` with back-reference.

**Batched writes**: write to file on issue, every 5 passes, or completion.

If more tests: update Current Test, loop to Step 7.
If done: go to Step 10.

### Step 9: Resume From File

Read `uat.md`, find first `result: [pending]` test, announce progress, continue from there (go to Step 7).

### Step 10: Complete Session

1. Update `uat.md` frontmatter: status -> "complete"
2. Archive previous result artifacts to `.history/`
3. Write `.tests/test-results.json` and `.tests/coverage-report.json`
4. Update `index.json` with UAT results
5. **Register artifact**: Append to `state.json.artifacts[]` with `type: "test"`, `id: TST-NNN`, `path: "scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-test-P{N}-{slug}"`, `depends_on: exec_art.id`. Output directory is independent scratch.
6. If no issues: go to Step 13
7. If issues found: go to Step 11

### Step 11: Auto-Diagnose

Cluster related gaps by component/area. Spawn one debug Agent per cluster to investigate UAT failures — find root cause, fix direction, affected files, evidence (file:line). Update `uat.md` gaps with diagnosis results.

### Step 12: Gap Closure Decision

**If `--auto-fix`**: execute gap-fix loop directly.

**Otherwise**: present diagnosis summary and offer options:
1. Auto-fix (plan --gaps -> execute -> re-verify, max 2 iterations)
2. Debug deep -- Skill({ skill: "quality-debug" })
3. Plan fixes -- Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan", args: "--gaps" })
4. Manual fix

Update issue lifecycle during gap-fix loop (registered -> planning -> executing -> completed/failed).

### Step 13: Report

Display summary: target, smoke test results, UAT counts (passed/issues/skipped with severity breakdown), diagnosis coverage, auto-fix results, and suggested next command.

| E001 | error | Phase or task target required | Prompt user for phase number |
| E002 | error | Phase not verified (no verification.json) | Suggest Skill({ skill: "maestro-verify" }) |
| E003 | error | Smoke test failed (app won't start) | Suggest Skill({ skill: "quality-debug" }) |
| W001 | warning | Test scenarios failed | Auto-diagnose, suggest fix options |
| W002 | warning | Coverage below threshold | Suggest Skill({ skill: "quality-test-gen" }) |
