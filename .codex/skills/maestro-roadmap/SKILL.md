description: Dual-mode roadmap generation via 2-wave CSV pipeline. Light mode (default) runs scope/risk/dependency analysis → roadmap assembly. Full mode (--mode full) runs domain/competitive/tech-stack research → 7-phase specification document chain → roadmap. Both modes produce .workflow/roadmap.md.

<purpose>
Unified 2-wave roadmap generation using `spawn_agents_on_csv` with dual execution modes:

- **Light mode** (default): Wave 1 runs parallel requirement analysis agents (scope, risk, dependency). Wave 2 runs roadmap assembly agent producing `roadmap.md` with phases, milestones, and success criteria.
- **Full mode** (`--mode full`): Wave 1 runs parallel research agents (domain, competitive, tech stack). Wave 2 runs a single synthesis agent producing the 7-phase specification document chain (product brief, PRD, architecture, epics, roadmap).

**Common workflow**: Parse Input → Parallel Analysis/Research → Sequential Assembly/Synthesis → Output

### Shared Columns

| Column | Phase | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Input | Unique task identifier (string) |
| `title` | Input | Short task title |
| `description` | Input | Detailed instructions for this task |
| `deps` | Input | Semicolon-separated dependency task IDs |
| `context_from` | Input | Semicolon-separated task IDs whose findings this task needs |
| `wave` | Computed | Wave number (1 = analysis/research, 2 = assembly/synthesis) |
| `status` | Output | `pending` -> `completed` / `failed` / `skipped` |
| `findings` | Output | Key findings summary (max 500 chars) |
| `error` | Output | Error message if failed |

**Light-only**: `analysis_focus` (scope/risk/dependency)
**Full-only**: `research_focus` (domain/competitive/tech_stack), `doc_phase`, `output_file`

### Per-Wave CSV (Temporary)

Each wave generates `wave-{N}.csv` with extra `prev_context` column.
</csv_schema>

<invariants>
1. **Start Immediately**: First action is session initialization, then Phase 1
2. **Wave Order is Sacred**: Never execute wave 2 before wave 1 completes and results are merged
3. **CSV is Source of Truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state
4. **Context Propagation**: prev_context built from master CSV, not from memory
5. **Discovery Board is Append-Only**: Never clear, modify, or recreate discoveries.ndjson
6. **Graceful Degradation**: If Wave 1 fails, Wave 2 proceeds with seed input only
7. **Cleanup Temp Files**: Remove wave-{N}.csv after results are merged
8. **DO NOT STOP**: Continuous execution until all waves complete
</invariants>

<execution>

### Output Artifacts

| File | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `tasks.csv` | Master state -- all tasks with status/findings | Updated after each wave |
| `wave-{N}.csv` | Per-wave input (temporary) | Created before wave, deleted after |
| `results.csv` | Final export of all task results | Created in Phase 3 |
| `discoveries.ndjson` | Shared exploration board | Append-only, carries across waves |
| `context.md` | Human-readable report | Created in Phase 3 |
| `spec-config.json` | Session metadata (full mode only) | Created in Phase 1 |

### Session Structure

**Light mode**:
```
.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-roadmap-{slug}/
+-- tasks.csv, results.csv, discoveries.ndjson, context.md
```

**Full mode**:
```
.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-roadmap-full-{slug}/
+-- tasks.csv, results.csv, discoveries.ndjson, context.md, spec-config.json

.workflow/.spec/SPEC-{slug}-{date}/
+-- spec-config.json
+-- product-brief.md
+-- glossary.json
+-- requirements/
|   +-- _index.md
|   +-- REQ-NNN-{slug}.md
|   +-- NFR-{type}-NNN-{slug}.md
+-- architecture/
|   +-- _index.md
|   +-- ADR-NNN-{slug}.md
+-- epics/
|   +-- _index.md
|   +-- EPIC-NNN-{slug}.md
+-- readiness-report.md
+-- spec-summary.md
```

### Session Initialization

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract:
- `mode` from `--mode light|full` (default: `light`)
- `AUTO_YES` from `--yes` / `-y`
- `targetPhases` from `--phases N` (light mode only)
- `skipResearch` from `--skip-research` (full mode only)
- `brainstormSession` from `--from-brainstorm <SESSION-ID>`
- `requirementArg` = remaining text after stripping all flags
- `slug` = requirementArg lowercased, non-alphanumeric → `-`, max 40 chars

Session ID: `{YYYYMMDD}-roadmap-{slug}` (light) or `{YYYYMMDD}-roadmap-full-{slug}` (full)
Session folder: `.workflow/.csv-wave/{sessionId}/` — create via `mkdir -p`

### Phase 1: Input Parsing + CSV Generation

**Shared steps**:
1. **Input parsing**: Parse `{requirementArg}` -- direct text or `@file` reference
2. **Brainstorm import**: If `--from-brainstorm`, read `guidance-specification.md` for enriched context
3. **Codebase detection**: Check for source files; if found, add context to analysis/research prompts
4. **Load project specs**: Read `.workflow/specs/` for constraint awareness

**Light mode specific**:
5. **Uncertainty assessment**:

| Factor | Low | Medium | High |
|--------|-----|--------|------|
| Scope clarity | Requirements explicit | Some ambiguity | Vague/open-ended |
| Technical risk | Proven stack | Some unknowns | New technology |
| Dependency unknown | All mapped | Some unclear | Many external |
| Domain familiarity | Expert | Moderate | New domain |
| Requirement stability | Locked | Some flux | Evolving |

Strategy: >=3 high → progressive, >=3 low → direct, else → ask (or auto if -y).

6. **CSV generation**: 3 analysis tasks (wave 1) + 1 assembly task (wave 2)

**Full mode specific**:
5. **Session init**: Create `spec-config.json` with session metadata
6. **CSV generation**: 3 research tasks (wave 1) + 1 document chain task (wave 2). If `--skip-research`: 0 research + 1 doc chain (wave 1).

**User validation**: Display task breakdown + strategy (skip if AUTO_YES).

### Phase 2: Wave Execution Engine

#### Wave 1 (Parallel)

Filter master `tasks.csv` for `wave == 1 AND status == pending` → write `wave-1.csv`.

```javascript
spawn_agents_on_csv({
  csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1.csv`,
  id_column: "id",
  instruction: mode === 'light'
    ? buildAnalysisInstruction(sessionFolder, requirementArg, strategy)
    : buildResearchInstruction(sessionFolder, requirementArg),
  max_concurrency: 3,
  max_runtime_seconds: 3600,
  output_csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1-results.csv`,
  output_schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      id: { type: "string" },
      status: { type: "string", enum: ["completed", "failed"] },
      findings: { type: "string" },
      output_file: { type: "string" },  // full mode only
      error: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["id", "status", "findings"]
  }
})
```

Merge results into master `tasks.csv`, delete `wave-1.csv`.

#### Wave 2 (Sequential)

Filter for `wave == 2 AND status == pending`. If all wave 1 tasks failed, use degraded mode (requirement/seed text only).

Build `prev_context` from wave 1 findings. Format: `[Task N: Title] summary...` per completed task. Inject decomposition strategy and `--phases N` constraint (light mode) into assembly prompt.

Write `wave-2.csv` with `prev_context` column → execute `spawn_agents_on_csv` → merge → delete temp CSV.

**Light mode**: Assembly agent produces roadmap.md with phases, milestones, success criteria.
**Full mode**: Document chain agent produces 7-phase spec package + glossary.json. If agent fails, export partial output and log quality issues (do NOT abort).

### Phase 3: Results Aggregation

Export master `tasks.csv` as `results.csv`.

**Interactive refinement** (skip if AUTO_YES): Present overview, collect feedback via AskUserQuestion (max 3 rounds).

**Full mode only — Readiness check**: Score on 4 dimensions (25% each):
- Completeness, Consistency, Traceability, Depth
- Gate: Pass (>=80%) / Review (60-79%) / Fail (<60%)

Generate `context.md`:

**Light mode template**:
```markdown
