<purpose>
Wave-based test generation using `spawn_agents_on_csv`. Each source file/module gets an independent agent that classifies, plans, and writes tests using RED-GREEN methodology. All agents run in a single parallel wave.

**Core workflow**: Discover Infrastructure -> Identify Gaps -> Classify Files -> Decompose to CSV -> Parallel Test Gen -> Aggregate Results

<invariants>
1. **Start Immediately**: First action is session initialization, then Phase 1
2. **Single Wave**: All test generation agents run in one parallel wave (independent topology)
3. **CSV is Source of Truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state
4. **RED-GREEN Methodology**: Write failing test first, then assess -- never write trivially passing tests
5. **Tests Expose, Not Fix**: Failing tests document bugs; source code changes are NOT permitted
6. **Discovery Board is Append-Only**: Never clear, modify, or recreate discoveries.ndjson
7. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Generated tests must match project's test conventions (imports, structure, assertions)
8. **Cleanup Temp Files**: Remove wave-{N}.csv after results are merged
9. **DO NOT STOP**: Continuous execution until all agents complete and results are aggregated
</invariants>

<execution>

### Session Initialization

```
Parse from $ARGUMENTS:
  AUTO_YES       ← --yes | -y
  continueMode   ← --continue
  maxConcurrency ← --concurrency | -c N  (default: 6)
  typeFilter     ← --type unit|integration|e2e  (default: all)
  framework      ← --framework jest|vitest|...  (default: auto-detect)
  phaseArg       ← remaining text after flag removal

Derive:
  dateStr        ← UTC+8 YYYYMMDD
  sessionId      ← "{dateStr}-testgen-P{phaseArg}-{phaseSlug}"
  sessionFolder  ← ".workflow/.csv-wave/{sessionId}"

mkdir -p {sessionFolder}
```

### Phase 1: Gap Analysis -> CSV

**Objective**: Discover test infrastructure, identify coverage gaps, classify files, generate tasks.csv.

**Decomposition Rules**:

1. **Phase resolution**: Resolve `{phaseArg}` via artifact registry in `state.json` to `.workflow/scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-{type}-{slug}/`

2. **Related session discovery**: Query `state.json.artifacts[]` for matching phase+milestone. Extract relevant outputs by type: review -> review.json (focused test targets), debug -> understanding.md (regression targets), test -> uat.md (behavior gaps).

3. **Test infrastructure discovery**: Scan for config files (`jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, `pytest.ini`, `.mocharc.*`), existing test files (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `test_*`), and test utilities. Read 2-3 existing tests to learn patterns. Error E003 if no framework detected.

3. **Gap identification**:

| Source | Gap Type | Priority |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `verification.json` gaps where status = MISSING | No test at all | HIGH |
| `coverage-report.json` requirements_uncovered | Untested requirement | HIGH |
| `verification.json` gaps where status = PARTIAL | Incomplete test | MEDIUM |
| Task summaries (modified files) | Changed code | LOW |

4. **File classification**:

| File Type | Test Category | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Pure function / utility | unit | Isolated, no side effects |
| React component | unit + e2e | Unit for logic, E2E for rendering |
| API route / handler | integration | Needs request context |
| Database model / query | integration | Needs DB connection |
| CLI command | e2e | Needs process execution |
| Config / types / constants | skip | No behavior to test |
| CSS / styles | skip | Visual, not testable |
| Test files themselves | skip | Don't test tests |

5. **Filter application**: If `--type` flag set, include only matching test type.

6. **Framework resolution**: Use `--framework` if provided, otherwise auto-detected framework.

7. **CSV generation**: One row per source file (skip category excluded).

**Wave computation**: Single wave -- all tasks are independent parallel (wave = 1).

**User validation**: Display test plan breakdown (skip if AUTO_YES).

### Phase 2: Wave Execution Engine

**Objective**: Execute test generation agents in parallel via spawn_agents_on_csv.

#### Wave 1: Test Generation (Independent Parallel)

1. Extract wave 1 pending rows from master `tasks.csv` into `wave-1.csv` (no prev_context needed)
2. Execute:

```javascript
spawn_agents_on_csv({
  csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1.csv`,
  id_column: "id",
  instruction: buildTestGenInstruction(sessionFolder),
  max_concurrency: maxConcurrency, max_runtime_seconds: 3600,
  output_csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1-results.csv`,
  output_schema: { id, status: [completed|failed], findings, tests_created, coverage_delta, error }
})
```

3. Merge results into master `tasks.csv`, delete `wave-1.csv`

**Agent Instruction** (`buildTestGenInstruction`): Each agent receives source file path, test type, detected framework, existing patterns, gap references, and RED-GREEN methodology (RED: write failing test -> verify it fails -> GREEN: assess if source satisfies). Agents must NOT fix source code -- failing tests document bugs. Discovery board protocol included.

### Phase 3: Results Aggregation

**Objective**: Run full suite, generate final results and human-readable report.

1. Export final `tasks.csv` as `results.csv`

2. **Run full test suite**: Categorize results as new passing (gap filled), new failing (bug discovered), existing broken (regression).

3. **Archive previous artifacts**: Move existing `test-gen-report.json` to `.history/` with timestamp before overwriting.

4. Build `test-gen-report.json`:

```json
{
  "phase": "<phase>",
  "generated_at": "<ISO>",
  "session_id": "<session-id>",
  "infrastructure": {
    "framework": "vitest",
    "test_dir": "__tests__/",
    "run_command": "npm test"
  },
  "classification": {
    "unit": ["src/utils/validate.ts", "src/hooks/useChat.ts"],
    "integration": ["src/api/comments.ts"],
    "e2e": ["src/components/ChatWindow.tsx"],
    "skip": ["src/types/index.ts"]
  },
  "generated": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "source_file": "src/utils/validate.ts",
      "test_file": "src/utils/__tests__/validate.test.ts",
      "test_type": "unit",
      "test_cases": 4,
      "status": "passing|failing|mixed",
      "bugs_discovered": []
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "files_generated": 5,
    "test_cases_total": 22,
    "passing": 18,
    "failing": 4,
    "bugs_discovered": 2,
    "coverage_delta": "+12%"
  }
}
```

5. **Generate context.md**: Report with summary (framework, file count, type filter), classification table (unit/integration/e2e/skipped counts), generation results per file (source, type, tests, status, bugs), test suite verification (passing/failing/regression counts), discovered bugs, and next steps.

6. **Update validation.json**: Change MISSING -> COVERED for gaps that now have tests.

7. **Copy** `test-gen-report.json` to phase `.tests/` directory.

8. **Register artifact**: Append to `state.json.artifacts[]` with `type: "test"`, `id: TST-NNN`, `depends_on: exec_art.id`.

9. Display summary.

**Next step routing**:

| Result | Suggestion |
|--------|------------|
| All tests passing | `maestro-verify {phase}` to update Nyquist coverage |
| Bugs discovered (failing tests) | `quality-debug --from-uat {phase}` to investigate |
| Regressions found | `quality-debug` immediately |
| Coverage still low | Run again with `--type` for uncovered layers |

### Shared Discovery Board Protocol

#### Standard Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `code_pattern` | `data.name` | `{name, file, description}` | Reusable code pattern found |
| `integration_point` | `data.file` | `{file, description, exports[]}` | Module connection point |
| `convention` | singleton | `{naming, imports, formatting}` | Project code conventions |
| `blocker` | `data.issue` | `{issue, severity, impact}` | Blocking issue found |
| `tech_stack` | singleton | `{framework, language, tools[]}` | Technology stack info |

#### Domain Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `test_pattern` | `data.name` | `{name, file, framework, description}` | Reusable test pattern (describe structure, assertion style) |
| `test_fixture` | `data.name` | `{name, file, setup, teardown}` | Shared test fixture or factory |
| `mock_strategy` | `data.module` | `{module, strategy, file}` | How a dependency is mocked |
| `bug_discovered` | `data.location` | `{location, test_file, description, severity}` | Bug found via failing test |

#### Protocol

Read `discoveries.ndjson` before test generation. Append-only: dedup by type+key before writing, never modify/delete.

```bash
echo '{"ts":"<ISO>","worker":"{id}","type":"test_pattern","data":{"name":"api-endpoint-test","file":"src/api/__tests__/users.test.ts","framework":"vitest","description":"supertest + vitest pattern for REST endpoints"}}' >> {session_folder}/discoveries.ndjson
```
</execution>

<error_codes>

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Phase directory not found | Abort with error: "Phase {N} not found" |
| No verification results found | Abort with error: "No verification results -- run maestro-verify first" |
| No test framework detected | Abort with error: "No test framework detected (E003)" |
| No gaps identified | Info: "No coverage gaps found -- phase fully tested" |
| Agent timeout | Mark as failed, continue with remaining agents |
| Test file write conflict | Agent checks for existing test, extends rather than overwrites |
| CSV parse error | Validate format, show line number |
| discoveries.ndjson corrupt | Ignore malformed lines |
| Continue mode: no session found | List available sessions |
| Regression detected in existing tests | Flag as blocker (W002), do not fix source code |
