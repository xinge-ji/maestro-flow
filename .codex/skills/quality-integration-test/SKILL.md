<purpose>
Linear pipeline test execution using `spawn_agents_on_csv`. Progressive L0 -> L1 -> L2 -> L3 layers where each layer depends on the previous passing. Self-iterating 6-phase cycle (Explore -> Design -> Develop -> Test -> Reflect -> Adjust) with adaptive strategy engine.

**Core workflow**: Explore Codebase -> Design Test Plan -> Progressive Layer Execution -> Reflect -> Adjust Strategy -> Iterate

<invariants>
1. **Start Immediately**: First action is session initialization, then Phase 1
2. **Wave Order is Sacred**: Never execute wave N+1 before wave N completes and results are merged
3. **Progressive Layers**: L0 -> L1 -> L2 -> L3 -- each layer gates the next
4. **CSV is Source of Truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state
5. **Context Propagation**: prev_context built from master CSV, not from memory
6. **Discovery Board is Append-Only**: Never clear, modify, or recreate discoveries.ndjson
7. **Self-Iterating**: Loop until convergence or max iterations -- do not stop after one pass
8. **Strategy is Adaptive**: Apply the strategy engine rules for transitions, never stay on a failing strategy
9. **Reflect Before Adjusting**: Always log reflection before changing strategy
10. **Cleanup Temp Files**: Remove wave-{N}.csv after results are merged
11. **DO NOT STOP**: Continuous execution until convergence or max iterations reached
</invariants>

<execution>

### Session Initialization

**Parse from `$ARGUMENTS`**:

| Variable | Source | Default |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `AUTO_YES` | `--yes` or `-y` | false |
| `continueMode` | `--continue` | false |
| `maxConcurrency` | `--concurrency N` or `-c N` | 4 |
| `maxIterations` | `--max-iterations N` | 5 |
| `targetCoverage` | `--target-coverage N` | 95 |
| `phaseArg` | remaining text after flag removal | — |

**Session path** (UTC+8 date prefix): `.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-integration-test-P{phaseArg}-{phaseSlug}/`

Create session directory. Initialize `state.json` with `{ phase, started_at, current_iteration: 0, max_iterations, strategy: "conservative", current_layer: "L0", pass_rates: [], convergence_threshold: targetCoverage, status: "running" }`. Initialize `reflection-log.md` with header.

### Phase 1: Exploration -> CSV

**Objective**: Explore codebase, discover integration points, design L0-L3 test plan, generate tasks.csv.

**Decomposition Rules**:

1. **Phase resolution**: Resolve `{phaseArg}` via artifact registry in `state.json` to `.workflow/scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-{type}-{slug}/`

2. **Related session discovery**: Query `state.json.artifacts[]` for all artifacts matching `phase === target_phase && milestone === current_milestone`. Each artifact's type determines its outputs: review → review.json (critical findings inform integration test focus), debug → understanding.md (root causes guide regression test layers), test → uat.md/.tests/ (prior results inform layer priorities). Extract conclusions that may affect integration test strategy.

3. **Codebase exploration**:
   - Cross-module imports and dependencies
   - API endpoints and route definitions
   - Database interactions and queries
   - External service integrations
   - Event flows and message passing

3. **Test infrastructure discovery**:
   - Detect frameworks (jest/vitest/pytest, playwright/cypress)
   - Find existing integration and E2E tests
   - Identify test utilities, fixtures, DB seed scripts

4. **Pre-generated test loading**:
   Check `{artifact_dir}/.tests/test-gen-report.json` for tests from `quality-test-gen`. Merge integration/e2e tests into plan (execute but don't re-generate).

5. **Layer design**:

| Layer | Wave | Tasks | Content |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| L0 | 1 | 1-2 | Type check + lint commands |
| L1 | 2 | 1 per module | Unit tests per discovered module (parallel) |
| L2 | 3 | 1-3 | Integration tests (API, DB, cross-module) |
| L3 | 4 | 1-2 | E2E tests (user flows) |

6. **Dependency wiring**: L1 depends on L0, L2 depends on L1, L3 depends on L2.

7. **CSV generation**: Rows for all layers with correct wave assignments and deps.

**User validation**: Display layer breakdown with test counts (skip if AUTO_YES).

### Phase 2: Wave Execution Engine

**Objective**: Execute test layers wave-by-wave via spawn_agents_on_csv. Progressive -- each layer requires previous to pass.

#### Wave 1: L0 Static Analysis

Filter `wave == 1 && status == pending` from master CSV. No prev_context (first wave). Write `wave-1.csv`.

```javascript
spawn_agents_on_csv({
  csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1.csv`,
  id_column: "id",
  instruction: buildL0Instruction(sessionFolder),
  max_concurrency: maxConcurrency,
  max_runtime_seconds: 3600,
  output_csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1-results.csv`,
  output_schema: { id, status: ["completed"|"failed"], findings, tests_passed, tests_failed, coverage, error }
  // required: id, status, findings
})
```

Merge results into master `tasks.csv`, delete `wave-1.csv`. **Gate**: If all L0 failed, skip remaining waves for this iteration.

#### Waves 2-4: L1 Unit -> L2 Integration -> L3 E2E

Each wave follows the same pattern: filter pending tasks for that wave, check deps (all previous wave tasks must not have all-failed), build `prev_context` from predecessor findings, write wave CSV, execute `spawn_agents_on_csv`, merge results, delete temp CSV.

| Wave | Layer | Parallelism | prev_context Source | Gate |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------------|------|
| 2 | L1 Unit | per module | L0 findings (type errors, lint warnings) | All L1 failed -> skip L2, L3 |
| 3 | L2 Integration | per scope | L1 findings (test commands, failures, coverage) | All L2 failed -> skip L3 |
| 4 | L3 E2E | per flow | L2 findings (integration points, coverage levels) | — |

### Phase 3: Reflect + Iterate

**Objective**: Evaluate results, reflect, adjust strategy, iterate or finalize.

#### Step 3a: Calculate Pass Rate

`overall_pass_rate = total_passed / (total_passed + total_failed) * 100`. Record in `state.json.pass_rates[]`.

#### Step 3b: Reflect

Analyze: which tests failed and why, trend (improving/plateauing/regressing), failure clustering, strategy effectiveness. Append to `reflection-log.md` per iteration: strategy, pass rate + delta, what worked, what failed, patterns detected, strategy assessment (effective/ineffective/partially_effective).

#### Step 3c: Adjust Strategy (Adaptive Strategy Engine)

| Condition | Strategy | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Iteration 1-2 | Conservative | Fix obvious failures, don't refactor |
| Pass rate >80% + similar failures | Aggressive | Batch-fix related failures |
| New regressions | Surgical | Revert last changes, fix regression only |
| Stuck 3+ iterations | Reflective | Re-analyze root cause pattern |

**Transitions**: Conservative --(>80%)--> Aggressive --(regression)--> Surgical --(fixed)--> Aggressive. Any --(stuck 3+)--> Reflective --(new insight)--> Conservative.

Update `state.json` with new strategy and iteration count.

#### Step 3d: Convergence Check

- `pass_rate >= target_coverage` -> **CONVERGED** -> finalize
- `iteration >= max_iterations` -> **MAX_ITER_REACHED** -> finalize
- Otherwise -> **ITERATE** -> reset failing layer tasks to pending, return to Phase 2

#### Step 3e: Finalize

1. Read final master `tasks.csv`
2. Export as `results.csv`
3. Build `summary.json`:

```json
{
  "phase": "<phase>",
  "completed_at": "<ISO>",
  "session_id": "<session-id>",
  "iterations": 3,
  "final_pass_rate": 97.5,
  "converged": true,
  "convergence_threshold": 95,
  "strategy_history": ["conservative", "conservative", "aggressive"],
  "layers": {
    "L0": { "status": "pass" },
    "L1": { "total": 15, "passed": 15, "failed": 0, "pass_rate": 100.0 },
    "L2": { "total": 8, "passed": 7, "failed": 1, "pass_rate": 87.5 },
    "L3": { "total": 4, "passed": 4, "failed": 0, "pass_rate": 100.0 }
  },
  "bugs_discovered": [],
  "regressions_fixed": []
}
```

4. Generate `context.md`:

```markdown
# Integration Test Report -- Phase {phase}

## Summary
- Iterations: {N}/{max_iter}
- Converged: {yes/no} (threshold: {threshold}%)
- Final pass rate: {rate}%
- Strategy: {final_strategy} (transitioned {N} times)

## Layer Results
| Layer | Status | Passed | Failed | Pass Rate | Coverage |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| L0 Static | {pass/fail} | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| L1 Unit | {status} | {P} | {F} | {rate}% | {cov}% |
| L2 Integration | {status} | {P} | {F} | {rate}% | {cov}% |
| L3 E2E | {status} | {P} | {F} | {rate}% | {cov}% |

## Iteration History
| Iter | Strategy | Pass Rate | Delta | Action |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | conservative | 72.0% | -- | fixed 3 type errors |
| 2 | conservative | 85.5% | +13.5% | fixed auth test fixtures |
| 3 | aggressive | 97.5% | +12.0% | batch-fixed API tests |

## Reflection Summary
{key insights from reflection-log.md}

## Bugs Discovered
{list of bugs found during testing}

## Next Steps
{suggested_next_command}
```

5. Copy `summary.json` to phase `.tests/integration/` directory.

6. Update `index.json` with integration test status.

7. **Register artifact**: Append to `state.json.artifacts[]` with `type: "test"`, `id: TST-NNN`, `path: "scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-integration-test-P{N}-{slug}"`, `depends_on: exec_art.id`. Output directory is independent scratch.

8. Display summary.

**Next step routing**:

| Result | Suggestion |
|--------|------------|
| Converged (>=target%) | `maestro-verify {phase}` to update validation |
| Max iter, >80% | `quality-test {phase}` for manual UAT on remaining gaps |
| Max iter, <80% | `quality-debug` for deep investigation |
| Bugs discovered | `maestro-plan {phase} --gaps` to plan fixes |

### Shared Discovery Board Protocol

#### Standard Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `code_pattern` | `data.name` | `{name, file, description}` | Reusable code pattern found |
| `integration_point` | `data.file` | `{file, description, exports[]}` | Module connection point |
| `convention` | singleton | `{naming, imports, formatting}` | Project code conventions |
| `blocker` | `data.issue` | `{issue, severity, impact}` | Blocking issue found |
| `tech_stack` | singleton | `{framework, language, tools[]}` | Technology stack info |

#### Domain Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `test_command` | `data.layer` | `{layer, command, flags, cwd}` | Working test command for a layer |
| `test_fixture` | `data.name` | `{name, file, setup, teardown}` | Shared test fixture or DB seed |
| `coverage_gap` | `data.module` | `{module, layer, uncovered_areas[]}` | Coverage gap in a module |
| `regression` | `data.test` | `{test, file, previous_status, current_status}` | Test that regressed |
| `flaky_test` | `data.test` | `{test, file, fail_rate, pattern}` | Intermittently failing test |

#### Protocol

1. **Read** `{session_folder}/discoveries.ndjson` before own test execution
2. **Skip covered**: If discovery of same type + dedup key exists, skip
3. **Write immediately**: Append findings as found
4. **Append-only**: Never modify or delete
5. **Deduplicate**: Check before writing

```bash
echo '{"ts":"<ISO>","worker":"{id}","type":"test_command","data":{"layer":"L1","command":"npx vitest run --reporter=verbose","flags":"--testPathPattern=unit","cwd":"."}}' >> {session_folder}/discoveries.ndjson
```
</execution>

| All tasks in a layer failed | Gate check: skip subsequent layers for this iteration |
| Agent timeout | Mark as failed, continue with remaining agents in wave |
| Max iterations without convergence | Finalize with current results, warn (W001) |
