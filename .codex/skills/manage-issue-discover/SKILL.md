<purpose>
Wave-based multi-perspective issue discovery using `spawn_agents_on_csv`. In default mode, 8 independent perspective agents scan the codebase in parallel (Wave 1), then a single dedup + issue creation agent aggregates all findings (Wave 2). In by-prompt mode, user-defined exploration dimensions replace the 8 fixed perspectives.

**Core workflow**: Parse Mode -> Define Perspectives -> Parallel Scan -> Dedup + Issue Creation

**Dual mode**:
- **Default (no args)**: 8-perspective scan (security, performance, reliability, maintainability, scalability, ux, accessibility, compliance)
- **`by-prompt "..."`**: User-driven exploration decomposed into 3-5 search dimensions

### Per-Wave CSV (Temporary)

Each wave generates `wave-{N}.csv` with extra `prev_context` column.

### Output Artifacts

| File | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `tasks.csv` | Master state -- all tasks with status/findings | Updated after each wave |
| `wave-{N}.csv` | Per-wave input (temporary) | Created before wave, deleted after |
| `results.csv` | Final export of all task results | Created in Phase 3 |
| `discoveries.ndjson` | Shared exploration board | Append-only, carries across waves |
| `context.md` | Human-readable discovery report | Created in Phase 3 |
| `discovery-state.json` | Session metadata and progress | Updated throughout |
| `.workflow/issues/issues.jsonl` | Issues appended here | Append-only |

### Session Structure

```
.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-discover-{mode}/
+-- tasks.csv
+-- results.csv
+-- discoveries.ndjson
+-- context.md
+-- discovery-state.json
+-- wave-{N}.csv (temporary)
```

Also writes to:
```
.workflow/issues/discoveries/{SESSION_ID}/
+-- discovery-state.json (copy)
+-- discovery-issues.jsonl
+-- {perspective}-findings.json (per perspective raw output)
```
</csv_schema>

<invariants>
1. **Start Immediately**: First action is session initialization, then Phase 1
2. **Wave Order is Sacred**: Never execute wave 2 before wave 1 completes and results are merged
3. **CSV is Source of Truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state
4. **Context Propagation**: prev_context built from master CSV, not from memory
5. **Discovery Board is Append-Only**: Never clear, modify, or recreate discoveries.ndjson
6. **Skip on Failure**: If all perspective agents failed, skip dedup
7. **Evidence Required**: Every finding must have file:line reference -- no speculative issues
8. **Dedup Before Create**: Never append to issues.jsonl without deduplication
9. **Cleanup Temp Files**: Remove wave-{N}.csv after results are merged
10. **DO NOT STOP**: Continuous execution until all waves complete
</invariants>

<execution>

### Session Initialization

```javascript
// Parse from $ARGUMENTS:
//   AUTO_YES   <- --yes | -y
//   continueMode <- --continue
//   maxConcurrency <- --concurrency N | -c N  (default: 8)
//   mode       <- "by-prompt" if clean args start with "by-prompt", else "multi"
//   userPrompt <- text after "by-prompt" (stripped of quotes)

// Session IDs (UTC+8):
//   sessionId    = DBP-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHmmss}
//   csvSessionId = {YYYYMMDD}-discover-{mode}
//   sessionFolder = .workflow/.csv-wave/{csvSessionId}
//   discoveryDir  = .workflow/issues/discoveries/{sessionId}

// Create: sessionFolder, discoveryDir, .workflow/issues/
// Touch: .workflow/issues/issues.jsonl
```

Initialize `discovery-state.json`:
```json
{
  "id": "{sessionId}",
  "mode": "{mode}",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "started_at": "{ISO}",
  "completed_at": null,
  "perspectives_completed": [],
  "issues_found": 0,
  "issues_deduplicated": 0
}
```

### Phase 1: Mode Resolution -> CSV

**Objective**: Determine mode, define perspectives/dimensions, determine scope, generate tasks.csv.

#### Multi-Perspective Mode (default)

**8 fixed perspectives**:

| # | Perspective | Focus | Guiding Question |
|---|-------------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | security | Auth, authz, input validation, secrets, injection | What security vulnerabilities or unsafe patterns exist? |
| 2 | performance | N+1 queries, loops, caching, memory, payloads | What performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies exist? |
| 3 | reliability | Error handling, retry, race conditions, data integrity | What failure modes are unhandled or could cause data loss? |
| 4 | maintainability | Duplication, coupling, abstractions, naming, dead code | What makes this codebase harder to understand or change? |
| 5 | scalability | Hardcoded limits, single-thread, stateful, schema rigidity | What will break or degrade as load/data/users increase? |
| 6 | ux | Confusing flows, feedback, consistency, loading states | What creates friction or confusion for end users? |
| 7 | accessibility | Screen reader, keyboard nav, contrast, ARIA, focus | What barriers exist for users with disabilities? |
| 8 | compliance | Logging, audit trails, retention, privacy, regulatory | What regulatory or policy requirements are not met? |

**CSV generation**: 8 perspective rows (wave 1) + 1 dedup row (wave 2).

**Scope detection**: Default `src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`. Refine by reading `.workflow/project.md` for tech stack hints.

#### By-Prompt Mode

1. Parse `userPrompt` -- if empty, ask user interactively
2. Decompose prompt into 3-5 exploration dimensions (use analysis to break down the user's intent into searchable dimensions)
3. For each dimension: define name, description, search patterns, file patterns, finding criteria
4. Store dimensions in `{discoveryDir}/exploration-plan.json`
5. Generate N dimension rows (wave 1) + 1 dedup row (wave 2)

**Specs loading**: `specs_content = maestro spec load --category coding` -- pass to agents for severity calibration.

**User validation**: Display perspective/dimension breakdown (skip if AUTO_YES).

### Phase 2: Wave Execution Engine

**Objective**: Execute perspective scans wave-by-wave via spawn_agents_on_csv.

#### Wave 1: Perspective/Dimension Scans (Parallel)

1. Read master `tasks.csv`
2. Filter rows where `wave == 1` AND `status == pending`
3. No prev_context needed (wave 1 has no predecessors)
4. Write `wave-1.csv`
5. Execute:

```javascript
spawn_agents_on_csv({
  csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1.csv`,
  id_column: "id",
  instruction: buildDiscoverInstruction(sessionFolder, discoveryDir, mode),
  max_concurrency: maxConcurrency,
  max_runtime_seconds: 3600,
  output_csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1-results.csv`,
  output_schema: { // required: id, status, findings
    id: "string", status: "completed|failed",
    findings: "string", issues_found: "string",
    severity_distribution: "string", error: "string"
  }
})
```

6. Merge `wave-1-results.csv` into master `tasks.csv`
7. Save per-perspective findings to `{discoveryDir}/{perspective}-findings.json`
8. Update `discovery-state.json` with completed perspectives
9. Delete `wave-1.csv`

**Perspective scan agent protocol**:
- Scan all source files matching scope_glob
- Identify concrete issues with file:line references
- Rate each finding: critical / high / medium / low
- Provide brief fix direction for each finding
- Report affected_components[]
- Share cross-cutting discoveries via discovery board
- Output issues_found as JSON array + severity_distribution as JSON object

#### Wave 2: Dedup + Issue Creation (Single Agent)

1. Read master `tasks.csv`
2. Filter rows where `wave == 2` AND `status == pending`
3. Check deps -- if all wave 1 agents failed, skip dedup
4. Build `prev_context` from wave 1 findings:
   ```
   [Task 1: Security Scan] Found 3 issues: SQL injection in query builder (critical), missing CSRF token (high)...
   [Task 2: Performance Scan] Found 5 issues: N+1 query in user listing (high), missing pagination (medium)...
   ...
   ```
5. Write `wave-2.csv` with `prev_context` column
6. Execute `spawn_agents_on_csv` for dedup agent
7. Merge results into master `tasks.csv`
8. Delete `wave-2.csv`

**Dedup agent protocol**:
- Merge all perspective findings from prev_context into single list
- Deduplicate: group by file path, compare descriptions (>80% overlap or same file:line → keep higher severity)
- For each unique finding: generate `ISS-YYYYMMDD-NNN` ID (collision-safe), build full issue record
  - Severity-to-priority: critical→1, high→2, medium→3, low→4; source = "discovery", tags = ["{perspective}"]
- Append to `.workflow/issues/issues.jsonl` and `{discoveryDir}/discovery-issues.jsonl`
- Report: pre-dedup count, post-dedup count, severity_distribution

### Phase 3: Results Aggregation

**Objective**: Generate final results and human-readable report.

1. Read final master `tasks.csv`
2. Export as `results.csv`
3. **Update discovery-state.json**:

```json
{
  "id": "{sessionId}",
  "mode": "{mode}",
  "status": "completed",
  "started_at": "{ISO}",
  "completed_at": "{ISO}",
  "perspectives_completed": ["security", "performance", "..."],
  "issues_found": 42,
  "issues_deduplicated": 31
}
```

4. Copy `discovery-state.json` to `{discoveryDir}/discovery-state.json`

5. **Generate context.md**:

```markdown
# Issue Discovery Report

## Summary
- Session: {sessionId}
- Mode: {mode}
- Perspectives: {perspective_count}
- Raw findings: {issues_found}
- Unique issues: {issues_deduplicated}

## Breakdown by Perspective
| Perspective | Findings | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|-------------|----------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| Security | {N} | {N} | {N} | {N} | {N} |
| Performance | {N} | {N} | {N} | {N} | {N} |
| ... | | | | | |

## Severity Distribution
| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | {N} |
| High | {N} |
| Medium | {N} |
| Low | {N} |

## Perspective Details
### {perspective_name}
{findings_summary}

**Top Issues:**
{top_issues_list}

## Issues Created
{list of ISS-YYYYMMDD-NNN IDs with titles}
```

6. **Display summary**: Session ID, mode, perspective count, raw vs unique finding counts, per-perspective breakdown, severity breakdown, and output file paths.

7. **Next step routing**:

| Result | Suggestion |
|--------|------------|
| Critical issues found | `$manage-issue "list --severity critical"` |
| Issues created | `$manage-issue "list"` |
| Specific area needs deeper look | `$manage-issue-discover "by-prompt '...'"` |
| Full scan complete | `$manage-issue "list --source discovery"` |

### Shared Discovery Board Protocol

#### Standard Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `code_pattern` | `data.name` | `{name, file, description}` | Reusable code pattern found |
| `integration_point` | `data.file` | `{file, description, exports[]}` | Module connection point |
| `convention` | singleton | `{naming, imports, formatting}` | Project code conventions |
| `blocker` | `data.issue` | `{issue, severity, impact}` | Blocking issue found |
| `tech_stack` | singleton | `{framework, language, tools[]}` | Technology stack info |

#### Domain Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `vulnerability` | `data.location` | `{location, type, severity, cwe}` | Security vulnerability |
| `code_smell` | `data.location` | `{location, type, severity, description}` | Code quality issue |
| `performance_hotspot` | `data.location` | `{location, type, impact}` | Performance issue |
| `reliability_risk` | `data.location` | `{location, failure_mode, impact}` | Reliability concern |
| `scalability_limit` | `data.location` | `{location, constraint, threshold}` | Scalability bottleneck |

#### Protocol

1. **Read** `{session_folder}/discoveries.ndjson` before own scan
2. **Skip covered**: If discovery of same type + dedup key exists, skip
3. **Write immediately**: Append findings as found
4. **Append-only**: Never modify or delete
5. **Deduplicate**: Check before writing

```bash
echo '{"ts":"<ISO>","worker":"{id}","type":"vulnerability","data":{"location":"src/auth/login.ts:42","type":"sql_injection","severity":"critical","cwe":"CWE-89"}}' >> {session_folder}/discoveries.ndjson
```
</execution>

<error_codes>

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| `.workflow/` does not exist | Abort: "No project initialized. Run maestro-init first." |
| `by-prompt` with empty prompt | Interactive prompt with suggested options |
| Perspective agent timeout | Mark as failed, continue remaining perspectives |
| All perspective agents failed | Skip dedup, report no findings |
| Dedup agent failed | Use wave 1 results directly, create issues from raw findings |
| issues.jsonl write failure | Retry once, then report error with findings in context.md |
| CSV parse error | Validate format, show line number |
| discoveries.ndjson corrupt | Ignore malformed lines |
| Continue mode: no session found | List available sessions |
| ID collision in issues.jsonl | Re-read file, recalculate next sequence number |
