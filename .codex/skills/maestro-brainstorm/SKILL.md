<invariants>
1. **Start Immediately**: First action is session initialization, then Phase 1
2. **Wave Order is Sacred**: Never execute wave 2 before wave 1 completes and results are merged
3. **CSV is Source of Truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state
4. **Context Propagation**: prev_context built from master CSV, not from memory
5. **Guidance First**: Wave 1 (guidance) MUST complete before any role analysis begins
6. **Discovery Board is Append-Only**: Never clear, modify, or recreate discoveries.ndjson
7. **Skip on Failure**: If guidance fails, abort. If all roles fail, skip synthesis.
8. **Cleanup Temp Files**: Remove wave-{N}.csv after results are merged
9. **DO NOT STOP**: Continuous execution until all waves complete
10. **9 Valid Roles Only**: data-architect, product-manager, product-owner, scrum-master, subject-matter-expert, system-architect, test-strategist, ui-designer, ux-expert
</invariants>

<execution>

### Session Initialization

```
Parse from $ARGUMENTS:
  AUTO_YES       ← --yes | -y
  continueMode   ← --continue
  maxConcurrency ← --concurrency | -c N  (default: 6)
  roleCount      ← --count N  (default: 3, max: 9)
  skipQuestions   ← --skip-questions
  topicArg       ← remaining text after flag removal

Derive:
  slug           ← topicArg kebab-cased, max 40 chars
  dateStr        ← UTC+8 YYYYMMDD
  sessionId      ← "{dateStr}-brainstorm-{slug}"
  sessionFolder  ← ".workflow/.csv-wave/{sessionId}"

mkdir -p {sessionFolder}/.brainstorming
```

### Phase 1: Topic Resolution -> CSV

**Objective**: Parse topic, select roles, generate tasks.csv.

**Decomposition Rules**:

1. **Mode detection**: Number = phase mode (resolve via state.json artifact registry to `.workflow/scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-{type}-{slug}/`), text = scratch mode
2. **Project specs loading**: Read `.workflow/specs/` for architecture-aware analysis context
3. **Role selection**:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `--yes` flag | Auto-select top `roleCount` roles based on topic relevance |
| Interactive | AskUserQuestion (multiSelect=true) with recommended roles + rationale |

4. **Valid roles** (9 total):

| Role ID | Focus Area |
|---------|------------|
| `data-architect` | Data models, storage strategies, data flow |
| `product-manager` | Product strategy, roadmap, prioritization |
| `product-owner` | Backlog management, user stories, acceptance criteria |
| `scrum-master` | Process facilitation, impediment removal |
| `subject-matter-expert` | Domain knowledge, business rules, compliance |
| `system-architect` | Technical architecture, scalability, integration |
| `test-strategist` | Test strategy, quality assurance |
| `ui-designer` | Visual design, mockups, design systems |
| `ux-expert` | User research, information architecture, journey |

5. **CSV generation**: 1 guidance row (wave 1) + N role rows (wave 2) + 1 synthesis row (wave 3).

**Wave computation**: 3-wave diamond -- guidance = wave 1, all role tasks = wave 2, synthesis = wave 3.

**User validation**: Display task breakdown (skip if AUTO_YES).

### Phase 2: Wave Execution Engine

**Objective**: Execute brainstorm pipeline wave-by-wave via spawn_agents_on_csv.

#### Wave 1: Guidance Specification (Single Agent)

1. Extract wave 1 pending rows from master `tasks.csv` into `wave-1.csv` (no prev_context needed)
2. Execute:

```javascript
spawn_agents_on_csv({
  csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1.csv`,
  id_column: "id",
  instruction: buildGuidanceInstruction(sessionFolder, topicArg),
  max_concurrency: 1, max_runtime_seconds: 3600,
  output_csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1-results.csv`,
  output_schema: { id, status: [completed|failed], findings, analysis_file, error }
})
```

3. Merge results into master `tasks.csv`, delete `wave-1.csv`
4. Read generated `guidance-specification.md` for wave 2 context propagation

**Guidance agent responsibilities**:
- Analyze topic, extract 5-10 core domain terms
- Define non-goals and scope boundaries
- Decompose into features (max 8): F-{3-digit} ID, kebab-case slug, description, related roles, priority
- Apply RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY, MUST NOT, SHOULD NOT)
- Write `guidance-specification.md` to `.brainstorming/`

#### Wave 2: Role Analysis (Parallel, 3-9 Agents)

1. Extract wave 2 pending rows from master `tasks.csv`
2. Build `prev_context` from wave 1 findings + `guidance-specification.md` content
3. Write `wave-2.csv` with `prev_context` column
4. Execute:

```javascript
spawn_agents_on_csv({
  csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-2.csv`,
  id_column: "id",
  instruction: buildRoleAnalysisInstruction(sessionFolder),
  max_concurrency: maxConcurrency, max_runtime_seconds: 3600,
  output_csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-2-results.csv`,
  output_schema: { id, status: [completed|failed], findings, analysis_file, error }
})
```

5. Merge results into master `tasks.csv`, delete `wave-2.csv`

**Role agent responsibilities**:
- Read guidance-specification.md for framework context
- Analyze topic through role-specific lens
- Feature-point organization when feature list available:
  - `analysis.md` -- Role overview INDEX only (< 1500 words)
  - `analysis-cross-cutting.md` -- Cross-feature decisions (< 2000 words)
  - `analysis-F-{id}-{slug}.md` -- Per-feature analysis (< 2000 words each)
- Fallback organization (no feature list):
  - `analysis.md` -- Main analysis (< 3000 words)
- system-architect MUST include: Data Model, State Machine, Error Handling, Observability, Configuration Model
- Write analysis files to `.brainstorming/{role}/`

#### Wave 3: Synthesis + Feature Index (Single Agent)

1. If all wave 2 tasks failed, skip synthesis entirely
2. Extract wave 3 pending rows, build `prev_context` from wave 2 findings
3. Write `wave-3.csv`, execute `spawn_agents_on_csv` for synthesis agent (same output_schema pattern)
4. Merge results into master `tasks.csv`, delete `wave-3.csv`

**Synthesis agent responsibilities**:
- Cross-role analysis: consensus, conflicts, unique contributions
- Conflict resolution with [RESOLVED]/[SUGGESTED]/[UNRESOLVED] tags
- Feature mode: generate `feature-specs/F-{id}-{slug}.md` per feature (7 sections, 1500-2500 words)
- Fallback mode: generate `synthesis-specification.md`
- Build `feature-index.json` and `synthesis-changelog.md`
- Four-Layer Aggregation: Direct Reference, Structured Extraction, Conflict Distillation, Cross-Feature Annotation

### Phase 3: Results Aggregation

**Objective**: Generate final results and human-readable report.

1. Export final `tasks.csv` as `results.csv`
2. Generate `context.md`:

```markdown
# Brainstorm Report -- {topic}

## Summary
- Topic: {topic}
- Roles analyzed: {role_count}
- Features decomposed: {feature_count}
- Conflicts resolved: {resolved_count}

## Guidance Specification
{summary of guidance-specification.md}

## Role Analysis Results
### {role_name}
{findings summary}
**Analysis file**: {analysis_file path}

## Synthesis
{synthesis summary}
- Consensus areas: {list}
- Resolved conflicts: {list}
- Unresolved items: {list}

## Feature Index
{feature-index.json summary}

## Next Steps
- Skill: maestro-analyze -- Evaluate feasibility + lock decisions
- Skill: maestro-plan -- Plan directly if scope is clear
- Skill: maestro-roadmap --mode full -- Generate full spec package from brainstorm
```

4. Copy artifacts to output `.brainstorming/` directory (phase mode or scratch mode target)
5. Update phase `index.json` with brainstorm status (if phase mode)
6. Display summary with next step suggestions

### Shared Discovery Board Protocol

#### Standard Discovery Types

|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `code_pattern` | `data.name` | `{name, file, description}` | Reusable code pattern found |
| `integration_point` | `data.file` | `{file, description, exports[]}` | Module connection point |
| `convention` | singleton | `{naming, imports, formatting}` | Project code conventions |
| `blocker` | `data.issue` | `{issue, severity, impact}` | Blocking issue found |
| `tech_stack` | singleton | `{framework, language, tools[]}` | Technology stack info |

#### Domain Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
