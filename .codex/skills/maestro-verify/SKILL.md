<purpose>
Wave-based 3-layer Goal-Backward verification using `spawn_agents_on_csv`. Decomposes verification into staged parallel checks across three waves: truth + artifact existence (Wave 1), artifact substance + wiring (Wave 2), anti-pattern scan + Nyquist audit (Wave 3).

**Core workflow**: Load Phase Artifacts -> Establish Must-Haves -> Decompose Checks -> Staged Parallel Verification -> Aggregate + Fix Plans

**Core principle**: Task completion != Goal achievement. A task marked complete may contain stubs/placeholders. This verifier checks that goals are actually achieved.

### Per-Wave CSV (Temporary)

Each wave generates `wave-{N}.csv` with extra `prev_context` column.

### Output Artifacts

| File | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `tasks.csv` | Master state -- all tasks with status/findings | Updated after each wave |
| `wave-{N}.csv` | Per-wave input (temporary) | Created before wave, deleted after |
| `results.csv` | Final export of all task results | Created in Phase 3 |
| `discoveries.ndjson` | Shared exploration board | Append-only, carries across waves |
| `context.md` | Human-readable verification report | Created in Phase 3 |
| `verification.json` | Structured verification output for downstream | Created in Phase 3 |
| `validation.json` | Nyquist test coverage output (if ran) | Created in Phase 3 |

### Session Structure

```
.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-verify-P{N}-{slug}/
+-- tasks.csv
+-- results.csv
+-- discoveries.ndjson
+-- context.md
+-- verification.json
+-- validation.json (if Nyquist ran)
+-- wave-{N}.csv (temporary)
```
</csv_schema>

<invariants>
1. **Start Immediately**: First action is session initialization, then Phase 1
2. **Wave Order is Sacred**: Never execute wave 2 before wave 1 completes and results are merged
3. **CSV is Source of Truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state
4. **Context Propagation**: prev_context built from master CSV, not from memory
5. **Discovery Board is Append-Only**: Never clear, modify, or recreate discoveries.ndjson
6. **Skip on Failure**: If artifact existence check failed, skip its substance/wiring checks
7. **Respect Skip Flags**: `--skip-tests` and `--skip-antipattern` mark wave 3 tasks as skipped, not removed
8. **Cleanup Temp Files**: Remove wave-{N}.csv after results are merged
9. **DO NOT STOP**: Continuous execution until all waves complete
10. **Goal-Backward**: Verify goals are achieved, not just tasks completed
</invariants>

<execution>

### Session Initialization

**Parse from `$ARGUMENTS`**:

| Variable | Source | Default |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `AUTO_YES` | `--yes` or `-y` | false |
| `continueMode` | `--continue` | false |
| `maxConcurrency` | `--concurrency N` or `-c N` | 4 |
| `skipTests` | `--skip-tests` | false |
| `skipAntipattern` | `--skip-antipattern` | false |
| `phaseArg` | remaining text after flag removal | — |

**Session path** (UTC+8 date prefix): `.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-verify-P{phaseArg}-{phaseSlug}/`

Create session directory.

### Phase 1: Phase Resolution -> CSV

**Objective**: Resolve phase, load artifacts, establish must-haves, decompose into check tasks, generate tasks.csv.

**Decomposition Rules**:

1. **Phase resolution**: Resolve `{phaseArg}` via artifact registry in `state.json` to `.workflow/scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-{type}-{slug}/`
2. **Artifact loading**: Read from phase directory:
   - `index.json` -- success_criteria (ground truth for verification)
   - `plan.json` -- original plan with task_ids
   - All `.task/TASK-{NNN}.json` -- task definitions with convergence.criteria
   - All `.summaries/TASK-{NNN}-summary.md` -- execution results
   - `uat.md` (if exists) -- human UAT gaps to incorporate

3. **Must-have establishment** (priority order):
   - **success_criteria from index.json** -- primary contract
   - **convergence.criteria from task JSON** -- per-task completion criteria
   - **Derived from phase goal** -- fallback: derive 3-7 observable behaviors

4. **Must-have decomposition** into 3 layers:
   - **Truths**: Observable behaviors (e.g., "User can see existing messages")
   - **Artifacts**: Concrete file paths that must exist and be substantive
   - **Key Links**: Critical wiring between artifacts (e.g., "Chat.tsx imports /api/chat")

5. **Check task generation**: For each must-have, generate check rows:

| Layer | Check Types | Wave |
|-------|-------------|------|
| truth | observable_behavior | 1 |
| artifact (exists) | exists | 1 |
| artifact (substance) | substance | 2 |
| wiring | import_usage | 2 |
| antipattern | pattern_scan | 3 (skip if `--skip-antipattern`) |
| nyquist | test_coverage | 3 (skip if `--skip-tests`) |

6. **Wave computation**: Assign waves based on layer dependency chain:
   - Wave 1: truth + artifact/exists (no predecessors, parallel)
   - Wave 2: artifact/substance + wiring (need existence confirmation from wave 1)
   - Wave 3: antipattern + nyquist (need substance/wiring context from wave 2)

7. **Specs loading**: `specs_content = maestro spec load --category validation`

8. **CSV generation**: One row per check task.

**User validation**: Display check breakdown (skip if AUTO_YES).

### Phase 2: Wave Execution Engine

**Objective**: Execute verification checks wave-by-wave via spawn_agents_on_csv.

#### Wave 1: Truth Checks + Artifact Existence (Parallel)

Filter `wave == 1 && status == pending` from master CSV. No prev_context (no predecessors). Write `wave-1.csv`.

```javascript
spawn_agents_on_csv({
  csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1.csv`,
  id_column: "id",
  instruction: buildVerifyInstruction(sessionFolder, "wave1"),
  max_concurrency: maxConcurrency,
  max_runtime_seconds: 3600,
  output_csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1-results.csv`,
  output_schema: { id, status: ["completed"|"failed"], findings, gaps_found, fix_plan, error }
  // required: id, status, findings
})
```

Merge results into master `tasks.csv`, delete `wave-1.csv`.

**Truth check agent**: Identify supporting artifacts, check existence + substance + wiring indicators. Status: VERIFIED / FAILED / UNCERTAIN. Report gaps for FAILED with severity + fix direction.

**Artifact existence agent**: Check file on disk. Missing = gap (severity=critical). Exists = note size + structure for wave 2.

#### Wave 2: Artifact Substance + Wiring (Parallel)

Filter `wave == 2 && status == pending`. Skip substance check if all wave 1 existence checks failed for that artifact. Build `prev_context` from wave 1 findings (format: `[Task N: Title] status - summary`). Write `wave-2.csv`, execute `spawn_agents_on_csv`, merge results, delete temp CSV.

**Substance check agent**: <10 lines real logic or contains placeholder markers ("placeholder", "coming soon", "TODO: implement") = STUB. Otherwise SUBSTANTIVE.

**Wiring check agent**: Grep for import statements + actual usage beyond imports. Status: WIRED / ORPHANED / NOT_WIRED.

#### Wave 3: Anti-Pattern Scan + Nyquist Audit (Parallel)

Filter `wave == 3 && status == pending`. Mark as `skipped` per skip flags (`--skip-antipattern`, `--skip-tests`). Build `prev_context` from wave 1 + wave 2 findings. Write `wave-3.csv`, execute `spawn_agents_on_csv`, merge results, delete temp CSV.

**Anti-pattern scan agent**: Extract modified files from task summaries. Scan for TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK, placeholder content, empty returns, log-only functions, hardcoded test data, disabled tests. Categorize: Blocker / Warning / Info. Report as JSON array in `gaps_found`.

**Nyquist audit agent**: Detect test framework, map requirements to test files, classify COVERED / PARTIAL / MISSING. Run coverage if available. Report gaps + coverage percentage.

### Phase 3: Results Aggregation

**Objective**: Generate final results, fix plans, and human-readable report.

1. Read final master `tasks.csv`
2. Export as `results.csv`
3. **Aggregate must_haves** from all check results:

```json
{
  "truths": [
    { "claim": "User can see existing messages", "status": "verified", "evidence": "Chat.tsx renders from /api/chat GET" }
  ],
  "artifacts": [
    { "path": "src/components/Chat.tsx", "status": "exists", "substantive": true }
  ],
  "key_links": [
    { "from": "Chat.tsx -> /api/chat", "status": "wired" }
  ]
}
```

4. **Collect all gaps** from all tasks' `gaps_found` columns + UAT gaps (if uat.md exists)
5. **Generate fix plans**: Cluster related gaps -> generate plan per cluster -> order by dependency
6. **Build verification.json**:

```json
{
  "phase": "<phase>",
  "status": "passed|gaps_found|human_needed",
  "verified_at": "<ISO>",
  "verifier": "csv-wave-verifier",
  "must_haves": { "truths": [...], "artifacts": [...], "key_links": [...] },
  "gaps": [...],
  "antipatterns": [...],
  "fix_plans": [...],
  "human_verification": [...],
  "coverage_score": 0.85
}
```

7. **Build validation.json** (if Nyquist ran):

```json
{
  "phase": "<phase>",
  "status": "passed|gaps_found",
  "validated_at": "<ISO>",
  "test_framework": "vitest",
  "coverage": { "statements": 80, "branches": 72, "functions": 85, "lines": 78 },
  "requirement_coverage": [
    { "requirement": "REQ-001", "tests": ["auth.spec.ts"], "status": "covered" }
  ],
  "gaps": [...]
}
```

8. **Generate context.md**:

```markdown
# Verification Report -- Phase {phase}

## Summary
- Truths: {verified}/{total} verified
- Artifacts: {artifact_verified}/{artifact_total} (L1-L3)
- Wiring: {links_wired}/{links_total} key links
- Anti-patterns: {blocker_count} blockers, {warning_count} warnings
- Nyquist: {coverage_pct}% coverage ({skipped|status})

## Overall Status: **{status}**

## Must-Have Truths
### {truth_claim}
Status: {VERIFIED|FAILED|UNCERTAIN}
Evidence: {evidence}

## Artifact Checks
| Path | Exists | Substantive | Wired | Status |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|--------|

## Key Links
| Link | Status | Evidence |

## Gaps
| ID | Type | Severity | Description | Fix Direction |

## Anti-Patterns
| File:Line | Pattern | Severity | Description |

## Fix Plans
### {cluster_name}
Objective: {objective}
Tasks: {task_list}
Issue Refs: {issue_ids}

## Nyquist Coverage
{requirement_coverage_table}
```

9. **Overall status determination**:

| Condition | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| All truths VERIFIED, all artifacts pass L1-L3, all key links WIRED, no blockers | passed |
| Any truth FAILED, artifact MISSING/STUB, key link NOT_WIRED, or blocker found | gaps_found |
| All automated checks pass but human verification items remain | human_needed |

10. **Auto-create issues** from gaps + blocker anti-patterns (ID format: `ISS-YYYYMMDD-NNN`).

11. **Archive previous artifacts**: Move existing `verification.json`/`validation.json` in phase dir to `.history/`.

12. **Copy outputs** to phase directory: `verification.json`, `validation.json` (if generated).

13. **Update phase index.json** with verification status and timestamps.

14. **Display summary**: Phase name, truths verified/total, artifacts L1-L3, wiring status, anti-pattern counts, Nyquist coverage, gaps by severity, fix plan count, issues created, human verification items, output file paths.

15. **Post-verify Knowledge Inquiry** (before next step routing):

| Signal | Prompt User | Spec Category |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Anti-pattern blockers found | "Update `quality-rules.md`?" | `quality` via `/spec-add` |
| Constraint/wiring violations | "Update `architecture-constraints.md`?" | `arch` via `/spec-add` |
| Recurring Nyquist coverage gaps | "Add to `test-conventions.md`?" | `test` via `/spec-add` |

On user confirm, append `<spec-entry>` to matching category file.

16. **Next step routing**:

| Result | Suggestion |
|--------|------------|
| All passed, no gaps | `$quality-review "{phase}"` for code review |
| Critical gaps found | `$quality-debug` for investigation |
| Minor gaps only | `$maestro-plan "{phase} --gaps"` -> `$maestro-execute` -> re-run `$maestro-verify` |
| Low test coverage | `$quality-test-gen "{phase}"` to generate missing tests |
| Human verification needed | `$quality-test "{phase}"` for interactive UAT |

### Shared Discovery Board Protocol

#### Standard Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `code_pattern` | `data.name` | `{name, file, description}` | Reusable code pattern found |
| `integration_point` | `data.file` | `{file, description, exports[]}` | Module connection point |
| `convention` | singleton | `{naming, imports, formatting}` | Project code conventions |
| `blocker` | `data.issue` | `{issue, severity, impact}` | Blocking issue found |
| `tech_stack` | singleton | `{framework, language, tools[]}` | Technology stack info |

#### Domain Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `verification_gap` | `data.gap_id` | `{gap_id, layer, severity, description}` | Verification gap found |
| `stub_detected` | `data.file` | `{file, line, marker, content}` | Stub/placeholder file detected |
| `broken_wiring` | `data.from+data.to` | `{from, to, expected, actual}` | Broken integration link |
| `antipattern` | `data.location` | `{location, pattern, severity}` | Anti-pattern instance |
| `test_gap` | `data.requirement` | `{requirement, status, suggested_test}` | Missing test coverage |

#### Protocol

1. **Read** `{session_folder}/discoveries.ndjson` before own check
2. **Skip covered**: If discovery of same type + dedup key exists, skip
3. **Write immediately**: Append findings as found
4. **Append-only**: Never modify or delete
5. **Deduplicate**: Check before writing

```bash
echo '{"ts":"<ISO>","worker":"{id}","type":"verification_gap","data":{"gap_id":"GAP-001","layer":"truth","severity":"critical","description":"User cannot send messages - form handler is a stub"}}' >> {session_folder}/discoveries.ndjson
```
