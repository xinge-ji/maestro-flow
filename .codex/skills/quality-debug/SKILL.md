### Per-Wave CSV (Temporary)

Each wave generates `wave-{N}.csv` with extra `prev_context` column.

### Output Artifacts

| File | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `tasks.csv` | Master state -- all tasks with status/findings | Updated after each wave |
| `wave-{N}.csv` | Per-wave input (temporary) | Created before wave, deleted after |
| `results.csv` | Final export of all task results | Created in Phase 3 |
| `discoveries.ndjson` | Shared exploration board | Append-only, carries across waves |
| `context.md` | Human-readable diagnosis report | Created in Phase 3 |

### Session Structure

```
.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-debug-P{N}-{slug}/
+-- tasks.csv
+-- results.csv
+-- discoveries.ndjson
+-- context.md
+-- wave-{N}.csv (temporary)
```
</csv_schema>

<invariants>
1. **Start Immediately**: First action is session initialization, then Phase 1
2. **Wave Order is Sacred**: Never execute wave 2 before wave 1 completes and results are merged
3. **CSV is Source of Truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state
4. **Context Propagation**: prev_context built from master CSV, not from memory
5. **Discovery Board is Append-Only**: Never clear, modify, or recreate discoveries.ndjson
6. **Skip on Refuted**: Wave 2 fix tasks skip if their hypothesis was refuted or inconclusive
7. **Cleanup Temp Files**: Remove wave-{N}.csv after results are merged
8. **DO NOT STOP**: Continuous execution until all waves complete
</invariants>

<execution>

### Session Initialization

```
Parse from $ARGUMENTS:
  AUTO_YES       ← --yes | -y
  continueMode   ← --continue
  maxConcurrency ← --concurrency | -c N  (default: 5)
  fromUat        ← --from-uat <phase>  (default: null)
  parallelMode   ← --parallel
  bugDescription ← remaining text after flag removal

Derive:
  slug           ← bugDescription kebab-cased, max 40 chars
  dateStr        ← UTC+8 YYYYMMDD
  sessionId      ← fromUat ? "{dateStr}-debug-P{fromUat}-{slug}" : "{dateStr}-debug-{slug}"
  sessionFolder  ← ".workflow/.csv-wave/{sessionId}"

mkdir -p {sessionFolder}
```

### Phase 1: Input Resolution -> CSV

**Objective**: Parse mode, gather symptoms or load UAT gaps, generate hypotheses, build tasks.csv.

**Decomposition Rules**:

1. **Mode detection**:

| Condition | Mode |
|-----------|------|
| `--from-uat` flag present | from-uat (load gaps from uat.md) |
| `--parallel` flag present | parallel (implies from-uat, one agent per gap cluster) |
| Neither flag | standalone (gather symptoms interactively) |

2. **Related session discovery**: Query `state.json.artifacts[]` for matching phase+milestone. Extract relevant outputs by type: execute -> .summaries/.task/, review -> review.json (guide hypotheses), debug -> understanding.md (avoid re-investigation), test -> uat.md.

3. **Symptom collection**:

| Mode | Source | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| standalone | User input | Ask 5 questions: expected, actual, errors, timeline, reproduction |
| from-uat | test artifact's uat.md (via registry) | Parse Gaps section, cluster by component |
| parallel | test artifact's uat.md (via registry) | Same as from-uat, one investigation per cluster |

3. **Hypothesis generation**: Per symptom cluster, analyze affected code and generate 3-5 ranked hypotheses (each becomes a wave 1 row).

4. **Fix task generation**: Pre-generate wave 2 fix row per hypothesis (`deps`/`context_from` -> hypothesis ID). Only executes if hypothesis confirmed.

5. **CSV generation**: Hypothesis rows (wave 1) + fix rows (wave 2).

**Wave computation**: Simple 2-wave -- all hypothesis tasks = wave 1, all fix tasks = wave 2.

**User validation**: Display hypothesis breakdown (skip if AUTO_YES).

### Phase 2: Wave Execution Engine

**Objective**: Investigate hypotheses wave-by-wave via spawn_agents_on_csv.

#### Wave 1: Hypothesis Investigation (Parallel)

1. Extract wave 1 pending rows from master `tasks.csv` into `wave-1.csv` (no prev_context needed)
2. Execute:

```javascript
spawn_agents_on_csv({
  csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1.csv`,
  id_column: "id",
  instruction: buildInvestigationInstruction(sessionFolder),
  max_concurrency: maxConcurrency, max_runtime_seconds: 3600,
  output_csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-1-results.csv`,
  output_schema: { id, status: [confirmed|refuted|inconclusive|failed], findings, evidence_for, evidence_against, error }
})
```

3. Merge results into master `tasks.csv`, delete `wave-1.csv`
4. **Filter for wave 2**: Mark fix tasks as `skipped` if their hypothesis was `refuted` or `inconclusive`

#### Wave 2: Fix Attempts (Parallel, Confirmed Only)

1. If no confirmed hypotheses remain, skip wave 2 entirely
2. Extract wave 2 pending rows, build `prev_context` from confirmed wave 1 findings
3. Write `wave-2.csv`, then execute:

```javascript
spawn_agents_on_csv({
  csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-2.csv`,
  id_column: "id",
  instruction: buildFixInstruction(sessionFolder),
  max_concurrency: maxConcurrency, max_runtime_seconds: 3600,
  output_csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-2-results.csv`,
  output_schema: { id, status: [fixed|fix_failed|failed], findings, fix_applied, verified, error }
})
```

4. Merge results into master `tasks.csv`, delete `wave-2.csv`

### Phase 3: Results Aggregation

**Objective**: Generate final results and human-readable report.

1. Export final `tasks.csv` as `results.csv`

2. **Generate context.md**: Debug report with summary (mode, hypothesis/confirmed/fixed/verified counts), per-hypothesis results (hypothesis, evidence for/against, findings, status), per-fix results (fix applied, verified, findings), aggregated root causes, and next steps.

3. **UAT update** (if --from-uat): Update `uat.md` gaps with `root_cause`, `fix_direction`, `affected_files` for confirmed hypotheses.

4. **Issue update**: If `issues.jsonl` exists, update matching issues with status `diagnosed`, add `context.suggested_fix` and `context.notes`.

5. **Register artifact** (phase-scoped only): Append to `state.json.artifacts[]` with `type: "debug"`, `id: DBG-NNN`, `depends_on: triggering_review_id || exec_art.id`.

6. **Post-debug Knowledge Inquiry**: Prompt user to capture knowledge when:
   - Recurring root cause pattern detected -> `/spec-add debug`
   - Non-obvious fix strategy used -> `/spec-add learning`
   - Architectural gap identified -> `/spec-add arch`

8. **Next step routing**:

| Result | Suggestion |
|--------|------------|
| All fixes verified | Run tests: `Skill({ skill: "quality-test", args: "{phase}" })` |
| Fixes applied, not verified | Re-verify: `Skill({ skill: "maestro-verify", args: "{phase}" })` |
| Confirmed but no fix | Plan fixes: `Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan", args: "{phase} --gaps" })` |
| All inconclusive | Resume with more context or manual investigation |
| From UAT, all diagnosed | `Skill({ skill: "quality-test", args: "{phase} --auto-fix" })` |

9. Display summary.

### Shared Discovery Board Protocol

#### Standard Discovery Types

| `code_pattern` | `data.name` | `{name, file, description}` | Reusable code pattern found |
| `integration_point` | `data.file` | `{file, description, exports[]}` | Module connection point |
| `convention` | singleton | `{naming, imports, formatting}` | Project code conventions |
| `blocker` | `data.issue` | `{issue, severity, impact}` | Blocking issue found |
| `tech_stack` | singleton | `{framework, language, tools[]}` | Technology stack info |

#### Domain Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `root_cause` | `data.location` | `{location, cause, severity, confidence}` | Confirmed root cause |

```bash
echo '{"ts":"<ISO>","worker":"{id}","type":"root_cause","data":{"location":"src/auth/login.ts:42","cause":"null_dereference","severity":"high","confidence":"confirmed"}}' >> {session_folder}/discoveries.ndjson
```

| UAT file not found for --from-uat phase | Abort with error: "uat.md not found for phase {N}" |
| No gaps in UAT file | Abort with error: "No failed gaps found in uat.md" |
| Hypothesis agent timeout | Mark as inconclusive, continue with remaining |
| All hypotheses refuted | Skip wave 2, suggest manual investigation |
| Fix agent timeout | Mark as fix_failed, report partial results |
| CSV parse error | Validate format, show line number |
| discoveries.ndjson corrupt | Ignore malformed lines |
