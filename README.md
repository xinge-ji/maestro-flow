Maestro-Flow is a workflow orchestration framework for multi-agent development with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and other AI agents. It automates the most time-consuming part of AI-assisted engineering — deciding which agents to use, in what order, with what context. Describe your intent, and Maestro-Flow routes to the optimal command chain, drives parallel agent execution, and closes the loop through a real-time dashboard, self-healing issue pipeline, and evolving knowledge graph.

---

## What It Does

You describe what you want. Maestro-Flow figures out which agents to use, in what order, with what context — and drives it to completion.

```bash
# Natural language — Maestro-Flow routes to the optimal command chain
/maestro "implement OAuth2 authentication with refresh tokens"

# Or step by step
/maestro-init                    # Set up project workspace
/maestro-roadmap                 # Create phased roadmap interactively
/maestro-analyze                 # Multi-dimensional analysis
/maestro-plan                    # Generate execution plan
/maestro-execute                 # Wave-based parallel agent execution
/maestro-verify                  # Goal-backward verification
```

### The Pipeline

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[init] --> B[brainstorm]
    B --> C[roadmap]
    C --> D[analyze]
    D --> E[plan]
    E --> F[execute]
    F --> G[verify]
    G --> H[review]
    H --> I[milestone-audit]
    I --> J[milestone-complete]
    J -->|next milestone| D
```

All work artifacts live in `.workflow/scratch/`, tracked by `state.json` artifact registry. Phases are labels in the roadmap, not directories.

### Quick Channels

| Channel | Flow | When |
|---------|------|------|
| `/maestro-quick` | analyze > plan > execute | Quick fixes, small features |
| Scratch mode | `analyze -q` > `plan --dir` > `execute --dir` | No roadmap, just get it done |
| `/maestro "..."` | AI-routed command chain | Describe intent, let Maestro-Flow decide |

---

## Four Pillars

### 1. Structured Pipeline

Scratch-based milestone workflow with artifact registry tracking. Each milestone moves through analyze > plan > execute > verify > review > milestone-audit > milestone-complete. All artifacts live in `.workflow/scratch/`, registered in `state.json`. The dashboard shows what's happening and what to do next.

49 slash commands across 6 categories power every stage — from project initialization to quality retrospective.

### 2. Autonomous Autopilot

**Commander Agent** — a background supervisor that runs a tick loop:

```
assess → decide → dispatch → wait → assess → ...
```

It reads project state (phases, tasks, issues, agent slots), decides what needs attention, and dispatches agents automatically. Three profiles: `conservative`, `balanced`, `aggressive`.

**Issue Closed-Loop** — issues aren't just tickets, they're a self-healing pipeline:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Discover] --> B[Analyze]
    B --> C[Plan]
    C --> D[Execute]
    D --> E[Close]
```

| Stage | Command | What Happens |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Discover** | `/manage-issue-discover` | 8-perspective scan: bugs, UX, tech debt, security, performance, testing gaps, code quality, documentation |
| **Analyze** | `/maestro-analyze --gaps` | Root cause analysis via CLI exploration, writes `issue.analysis` |
| **Plan** | `/maestro-plan --gaps` | Generate TASK files linked to issues via `task_refs` |
| **Execute** | `/maestro-execute` | Wave-based parallel execution with automatic issue status sync |
| **Close** | Automatic | All linked tasks completed > resolved > closed |

Quality commands (`review`, `test`, `verify`) automatically create issues for problems they find. Issue fixes flow back into the phase pipeline. The loop closes itself.

### 3. Visual Control Plane

Real-time project dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:3001`. Built with React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, and WebSocket live updates.

| View | Key | What You See |
|------|-----|-------------|
| **Board** | `K` | Kanban columns — Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done |
| **Timeline** | `T` | Gantt-style phase timeline with progress bars |
| **Table** | `L` | Every phase and issue in a sortable table |
| **Center** | `C` | Command center — active executions, issue queue, quality metrics |

Pick an agent on any issue card, hit play. Batch-select issues, dispatch them all in parallel. Watch agents work in a real-time streaming panel.

### 4. Smart Knowledge Base

The project builds intelligence over time through two systems:

**Wiki Knowledge Graph** — structured entries (specs, phases, decisions, lessons) connected by semantic links. BM25 search, backlink traversal, health scoring. `/wiki-connect` discovers hidden connections; `/wiki-digest` generates themed digests with coverage heatmaps and gap analysis.

**Learning Toolkit** — 5 commands that turn code and history into reusable knowledge:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/learn-retro` | Unified retrospective — git metrics + decision evaluation via `--lens git\|decision\|all` |
| `/learn-follow` | Guided reading with forcing questions — extracts patterns and builds understanding |
| `/learn-decompose` | 4-dimension parallel pattern extraction, saves to specs/wiki |
| `/learn-second-opinion` | Multi-perspective analysis: review, challenge, or consult modes |
| `/learn-investigate` | Systematic question investigation with hypothesis testing |

All learning commands share `lessons.jsonl` — a unified knowledge store queryable via `/manage-learn`. Specs, retrospectives, and manual insights all flow into the same pool.

## Under the Hood

### Multi-Agent Engine

Maestro-Flow coordinates multiple AI agents in parallel:

```
              ┌────────────────────────────────┐
              │      ExecutionScheduler         │
              │   (wave-based parallel engine)  │
              └───────────┬────────────────────┘
                          │
           ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
           │              │              │
     ┌─────┴─────┐ ┌─────┴──────┐ ┌────┴──────┐
     │  Claude    │ │   Codex    │ │  Gemini   │
     │ Agent SDK  │ │  CLI       │ │  CLI      │
     └───────────┘ └────────────┘ └───────────┘
```

- **Wave execution** — independent tasks run in parallel, dependent tasks wait for predecessors
- **Agent SDK** — native Claude Agent SDK for Claude Code processes
- **CLI adapters** — Codex, Gemini, Qwen, OpenCode all accessible through `maestro delegate`
- **Workspace isolation** — each agent gets a clean execution context

### Hook System

11 context-aware hooks across 3 installation levels:

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `context-monitor` | Monitors context usage, injects warnings when running low |
| `spec-injector` | Auto-injects project specs into subagent prompts by agent type + keyword |
| `keyword-spec-injector` | Scans user prompts for keywords, injects matching `<spec-entry>` entries |
| `spec-validator` | Validates `<spec-entry>` format on Write/Edit to `.workflow/specs/` |
| `delegate-monitor` | Tracks async delegate task completion |
| `team-monitor` | Collab heartbeat — reports activity to `.workflow/collab/activity.jsonl` for teammate awareness |
| `telemetry` | Execution telemetry collection |
| `session-context` | Injects workflow state at session start |
| `skill-context` | Injects workflow state when invoking workflow skills |
| `coordinator-tracker` | Tracks coordinator chain progress |
| `workflow-guard` | Protects critical files and enforces workflow constraints |

The `spec-injector` routes project specs to agents based on category — coding agents get coding conventions, planning agents get architecture constraints. The `keyword-spec-injector` provides entry-level precision — when a user prompt mentions "auth", only auth-related spec entries are injected. Session dedup prevents re-injection within the same session. A 4-tier context budget (full > reduced > minimal > skip) adapts injection volume to remaining context.

```bash
maestro hooks install --level minimal    # context-monitor + spec-injector
maestro hooks install --level standard   # + delegate/team/telemetry + session/skill-context + coordinator-tracker
maestro hooks install --level full       # + workflow-guard
```

### Overlay System

Non-invasive patches for `.claude/commands/*.md` — add steps, reading requirements, quality gates without editing originals. Overlays survive `maestro install` upgrades.

```bash
/maestro-overlay "add CLI verification after maestro-execute"
maestro overlay list                   # Interactive TUI management
maestro overlay bundle -o team.json    # Pack for sharing
```
